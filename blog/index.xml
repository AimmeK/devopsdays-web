      <description>In January 2015, Bridget Kromhout stepped up as the leader of the devopsdays core team, invited by founder Patrick Debois to replace him after he led devopsdays from 2009-2014. Bridget had organized devopsdays Minneapolis in July 2014, and was now ready to help streamline and improve processes to help other cities get started.
Over the next five years, Bridget scaled the organizing team up, adding core team members who could onboard and mentor new city teams, and seeking out core team members from communities and regions not previously represented.</description>

      <description>Quando escolhemos a Universidade Federal da Bahia (UFBA), tínhamos como objetivo nos aproximarmos da Academia, nos aproximarmos de uma Universidade Federal e assim, estreitar ainda mais os laços que esta comunidade de tecnologia tem com esse local que tanto formou e ainda forma profissionais para o mercado, não somente soteropolitano, mas sim para o mundo.
Escolhemos a Universidade Federal da Bahia, pois lá estão diversos grupos de professores e alunos que se beneficiariam profundamente com um evento dentro das suas instalações, e quem ainda não conhece a UFBA, teria o prazer de ver sua enorme praça verde, poderia descobrir uma Biblioteca imensa, poderia descobrir que lá está o ponto de presença de Rede Nacional de Pesquisa (RNP) que conecta a maioria dos órgãos federais e locais através da sua rede remessa.</description>

      <description>It&amp;amp;rsquo;s hard to believe but it is almost 10 years ago since #devopsdays happened for the first time in Gent. Back then there were almost 70 of us talking about topics that were of interest to both Operations and Development, we were exchanging our ideas and experiences `on how we were improving the quality of software delivery.
Our ideas got started on the crossroads of Open Source, Agile and early Cloud Adoption.</description>

      <description>Então você está pensando em organizar um devopsdays na sua cidade, hein? Nessa hora surgem várias dúvidas, as quais iremos responder da melhor maneira possível neste momento.
devopsdays é um evento internacional, não é meio grande demais para a minha cidadezinha? Definitivamente não, quanto mais diversos forem os locais onde o evento ocorre, mais diversa a discussão em torno de DevOps será, e isso significa que o ponto de vista das pessoas da sua comunidade local ainda não foram colocados em pauta e é a cultura DevOps que está perdendo com isso.</description>

      <description>ve&amp;amp;#183;loc&amp;amp;#183;i&amp;amp;#183;ty rapidity of motion or operation; swiftness; speed. If you&amp;#39;ve heard me talk about Agile Infrastucture, or read my personal blog, you might have noticed that I frequently make references to Velocity. When we started planning DevOpsDays US, there was consensus from the beginning to backdraft Velocity. I have a hard time saying &amp;amp;lsquo;DevOps&amp;amp;rsquo; was born at any one time or any one place, as doing so ignores a large body of individual and organizational work, knowledge and experience, but Velocity has to be considered seminal in the course of the formation and articulation of DevOps ideas and ideals.</description>

      <description>When we first started organizing DevOpsDays for the US, we all had slightly different visions about what we wanted to see and what we wanted to participate in.  On one hand, some of us really wanted to use Open Space Technology as the basis for some if not all of the program, while some of us really wanted to have presentations. We all wanted to have a &amp;amp;lsquo;community&amp;amp;rsquo; event, but we also wanted to leverage the expertise in that community.</description>
