      <description>In January 2015, Bridget Kromhout stepped up as the leader of the devopsdays core team, invited by founder Patrick Debois to replace him after he led devopsdays from 2009-2014. Bridget had organized devopsdays Minneapolis in July 2014, and was now ready to help streamline and improve processes to help other cities get started.
Over the next five years, Bridget scaled the organizing team up, adding core team members who could onboard and mentor new city teams, and seeking out core team members from communities and regions not previously represented.</description>

      <description>Quando escolhemos a Universidade Federal da Bahia (UFBA), tínhamos como objetivo nos aproximarmos da Academia, nos aproximarmos de uma Universidade Federal e assim, estreitar ainda mais os laços que esta comunidade de tecnologia tem com esse local que tanto formou e ainda forma profissionais para o mercado, não somente soteropolitano, mas sim para o mundo.
Escolhemos a Universidade Federal da Bahia, pois lá estão diversos grupos de professores e alunos que se beneficiariam profundamente com um evento dentro das suas instalações, e quem ainda não conhece a UFBA, teria o prazer de ver sua enorme praça verde, poderia descobrir uma Biblioteca imensa, poderia descobrir que lá está o ponto de presença de Rede Nacional de Pesquisa (RNP) que conecta a maioria dos órgãos federais e locais através da sua rede remessa.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe but it is almost 10 years ago since #devopsdays happened for the first time in Gent. Back then there were almost 70 of us talking about topics that were of interest to both Operations and Development, we were exchanging our ideas and experiences `on how we were improving the quality of software delivery.
Our ideas got started on the crossroads of Open Source, Agile and early Cloud Adoption.</description>

      <description>En las empresas modernas el desarrollo de Tecnologías de la Información (TI) debería ir aparejado con las operaciones TI; pero en las empresas tradicionales los desarrolladores y los especialistas de operaciones TI trabajan en departamentos diferentes con escasa comunicación entre ellos, provocando todo tipo de problemas que impactan los servicios que se proveen y perciben los clientes o usuarios finales.
Mitigar estos problemas entre los desarrolladores y especialistas de operaciones TI es el objetivo principal del movimiento DevOps.</description>

      <description>Então você está pensando em organizar um devopsdays na sua cidade, hein? Nessa hora surgem várias dúvidas, as quais iremos responder da melhor maneira possível neste momento.
devopsdays é um evento internacional, não é meio grande demais para a minha cidadezinha? Definitivamente não, quanto mais diversos forem os locais onde o evento ocorre, mais diversa a discussão em torno de DevOps será, e isso significa que o ponto de vista das pessoas da sua comunidade local ainda não foram colocados em pauta e é a cultura DevOps que está perdendo com isso.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is a report with data stats and lessons learned about DevOpsDays Sao Paulo 2018, held on 06 and 07 of June at Hotel Century Flat.
Goal Most events with DevOps subject in Brazil have more like Ops profile, others events that are trying to reach “DevOps public” add a track about that. But, often talks have subject around tools. We would like to discuss to invoke subjects beyond Infrastructure as Code and/or Continuous Delivery.</description>

      <description>Introduction Below is a small summary of an open space that took place at Devopsdays Ghent (October, 2014). The goal of the open space was to find ways on how Devopsdays organizers and attendees can contribute to NGOs or other good causes.
Two prior Devopsdays events donated some of the profits to charity. Devopsdays NY 2014 donated to the drilling of a well in Cambodia. Devopsdays Belgium 2014 donated to Manbarnootaaf VZW.</description>

      <description>Most devopsdays events are a combination of curated talks and self organized conversations. The self organized content is known as &amp;ldquo;open spaces&amp;rdquo;. Open Spaces give attendees the opportunity to talk about anything they&amp;rsquo;d like. A person might suggest a topic they want to learn about, or one they feel like they can help others with. The topics range widely, from highly technical, to pure culture, to board games for networking.</description>

      <description>Introduction Congratulations! The fact that you have reached this page means you at least have an interest in spreading the devops love to the world. Back in 2009 when we organized the first event, we were probably as excited as you are now. But we were also bit scared and full of questions: how does this work? how do we get sponsors? what is the first thing we have to do?</description>

      <description>The explosion of devopsdays events in recent years is exciting for everyone in the community. Some of us have been in this space since before the first event in Ghent, while others are joining with the newest events coming online in 2015. In the last year we&amp;rsquo;ve added new global core organizers, seen the originator of devopsdays (Patrick Debois) move into an advisory role, and been thrilled by rapid expansion in the numbers and locations of events.</description>

      <description>ve&amp;#183;loc&amp;#183;i&amp;#183;ty rapidity of motion or operation; swiftness; speed. If you&#39;ve heard me talk about Agile Infrastucture, or read my personal blog, you might have noticed that I frequently make references to Velocity. When we started planning DevOpsDays US, there was consensus from the beginning to backdraft Velocity. I have a hard time saying &amp;lsquo;DevOps&amp;rsquo; was born at any one time or any one place, as doing so ignores a large body of individual and organizational work, knowledge and experience, but Velocity has to be considered seminal in the course of the formation and articulation of DevOps ideas and ideals.</description>

      <description>When we first started organizing DevOpsDays for the US, we all had slightly different visions about what we wanted to see and what we wanted to participate in.  On one hand, some of us really wanted to use Open Space Technology as the basis for some if not all of the program, while some of us really wanted to have presentations. We all wanted to have a &amp;lsquo;community&amp;rsquo; event, but we also wanted to leverage the expertise in that community.</description>

      <description>Devops is usually viewed from a traditional perspective of a collaboration of Dev, Ops, and QA, driven by the change in Culture, People, and Process. But how do you know where you stand and where to move? As in almost any field, data and metrics give you the gauges and instruments. In this talk, we’ll talk about the key measurements for the DevOps transformation process and provide you with 3 metrics you can start measuring tomorrow.</description>

      <description>TALK ABSTRACT No matter what profession you’re in, our jobs can contain a variety of stress factors, which are unknown to individuals looking from the outside.
“TECH-LIVES MATTER: HANDS UP, DON’T REBOOT” is a lecture based on research that recommends corporations should devote in IT specific employee assistance agendas. Working as a Developer, Specialist, Designer, Engineer, Expert, Manager, and Technician demands a high level of precision over the extended period, and any minute lapse in one’s job could be disastrous.</description>

      <description>Nascido na Nuvem, o Nubank atende mais de 9 milhões de clientes alavancando microsserviços, ambientes conteinerizados, observabilidade e, na base de tudo isso, imutabilidade.
Vamos discutir por que tratamos infraestrutura como um problema de software e como imutabilidade pode ser aplicada em todos os níveis, da infra mais básica às aplicações, quais o ganhos dessas práticas em ambientes de computação em nuvem, e como isso nos permite não ter uma equipe dedicada a infraestrutura.</description>

      <description>We’ve spent six years studying secure coding practices of DevOps and Continuous Delivery organizations by surveying over 15,000 IT professionals. We’ve analyzed their staffing practices, educational priorities, automation choices, and process improvements that improve their cybersecurity preparedness. Our study has also uncovered details of where automation fails, awareness falls short and breaches happen.
Come participate in this session where we will share the 10 habits practiced by the DevSecOps Elite that you can then apply to – or further mature within – your own organization.</description>

We all know this isn&amp;rsquo;t the reality. From the ambiguity and the change in processes to not knowing where to buy the DevOps–DevOps can be frustrating. This talk will focus on 10 things I hate about DevOps (or maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t hate it at all).</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Are you kidding? It&amp;rsquo;s got fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles.&amp;rdquo; This describes not only devops, but the greatest movie of all time, The Princess Bride. With those similarities, perhaps there are lessons that we can learn from this great movie.
Devops is the greatest thing in the world, except for a nice MLT - mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich where the mutton is nice and lean.</description>

      <description>10 years ago we had the idea to organise a conference in Gent to bridge the gap between developers and the people runing their code. It was the start of a new global movement. We never predicted that #devops would be where #devops is today. The word devops has evolved, the community has evolved.
Docker has solved all of our problems, the ones left behind were solved by Kubernetes. Everybody and their neighbour is Scrum certified now and we are all happily sipping cocktails on the beach.</description>

      <description>Is it possible to enable the evolution of a monolith? After a hugely expensive (financially and culturally) failed attempt at a complete rewrite, Ticketmaster is attempting to do just that, bounce back and evolve the monolith that is Ticketmaster’s core ticketing platform. This multi-year effort requires striking a delicate balance between showing appropriate respect for the platform’s highly profitable 45 plus year history while not allowing past success to blind us to demands of a highly dynamic market of fans, artists, venues, and more.</description>

But given the growing concerns around COVID-19, we&amp;rsquo;ve made the difficult decision to cancel Boise DevOpsDays for 2020 due to the uncertainties of having a large event gathering.
Canceling the event was a tough decision to make. We have thoroughly enjoyed planning DevOpsDays Boise, and it’s one of our favorite ways to engage our local community.</description>

      <description>I have a more elaborate vision for DevOps. I define it as a culture where a diverse set of identities, genders, roles, educations, and techniques work together to ensure a balanced and focused perspective for team, product, and users. I hear this term often used when referring to only technical roles, but this version includes marketing, UX, design, and sales.
I’ll walk through the story of SnapCI, a now defunct continuous delivery tool, the unconscious silos the team built, how we broke them down, and one of the biggest mistakes me made when developing a new feature.</description>

      <description>En esta charla contaré el camino que comenzamos hace algo más de 5 años para implantar automatización tanto de gestión de la configuración como de infraestructura como código y que a día de hoy seguimos llevando a cabo en STR Sistemas principalmente con ansible y terraform. Tenemos la particularidad de gestionar múltiples clientes, con múltiples plataformas, proveedores y tecnologías.
En la charla podremos explorar cómo gestionamos el código, cómo hemos evolucionado con las herramientas y cómo sus versiones han influido en ello, cómo gestionamos las credenciales, la importancia en la retrocompatiblidad de cambios, lo que queremos hacer a futuro, etc.</description>

      <description>Managers have five important core responsibilities, which everyone in our industry tends to agree on. In no particular order, we can summarize them as
 be accountable and responsible for their team&amp;rsquo;s actions, provide direction and guidance to their teams, act as an interface to other teams, care about the people on their team, deliver the team&amp;rsquo;s product or service.  Most people appear to agree that in order for a manager to meet these responsibilities, the maximum team size under which that is realistically possible is about 10.</description>

      <description>July 2019 marked 50 years since the first humans set foot on the moon.
Moments before the historic landing of Apollo 11, the spacecraft computer started throwing errors and basically restarting every few seconds. The astronauts and mission control had to make split-second decisions and trust in the resiliency and reliability of the systems.
There are many lessons that can be learned from NASA’s efforts and in this session I will present a selection of lessons in the domains of resilience, reliability, performance and availability.</description>

That clearly shows the current state of our insecure apps and hence the importance of DevSecOps is even more prominent today with the need for transformational shift to improve AppSec</description>

Gartner warned executives to consider hiring PHD’s even though many will not use QC for possibly a decade. QC is already helping classical computing with improved algorithms, so we should be aware of what QC is and where it can be useful today.</description>

      <description>How can you save your engineering team from the costly trials and tribulations that come with new software development efforts? The answer is simple: establish a sprint zero. Before your user stories are ready, your development team should build a Hello World app on every deliverable type for your target technology. Use “sprint zero” to deploy and deliver all of these artifacts in every target environment for the new solution - all the way through up and into production.</description>

      <description>Making the decision to move apps or your entire enterprise to cloud services is not simple. You have to really get a good understanding of all the costs of doing this, not just the server costs vs cloud vm costs. The other thing to think about is how this is going to change your culture. You will lose people, and that is “ok.” We will dig deep into the finance side, look at costs of everything vs letting someone else do that for you.</description>

      <description>No matter the size of your business, structure is the key to success. Of course, not just any kind of structure will work; businesses need a structure that is as adaptable and fluid as your business&#39; needs are. For tech businesses, the most popular way to achieve this style of structure is by using Agile and DevOps. While some would argue that either works fine separately, Agile and DevOps truly shine when they are implemented in tandem.</description>

      <description>Microservice architectures provide immense benefits to the flexibility and speed of development, but they also introduce significant complexity in the way the distributed components interact with each other. Eventually, all distributed systems will encounter an error or failure. Sometimes these errors can express themselves outside of the isolation of single component and cause a series of cascading failures in interconnected system. This is the story of one such failure, the lessons learned, and how it&amp;rsquo;s influenced our architecture and design decisions moving forward.</description>

      <description>Containers are becoming the preferred method for deploying applications, but will they work for you and should they even be used? Several open-source technologies are maturing around containers including Docker Engine, Kubernetes, Swarm, and OpenShift.
There are significant benefits to working with containers. Some of the reasons to choose containerization include resource management, security, and portability. Despite the benefits, the technology and the ecosystem around them is overwhelming. This talk aims to demystify some of this complexity.</description>

      <description>The FT was a microservices pioneer, and our teams had a lot of freedom to pick the tools &amp;amp; processes they wanted. 5 years on, many people have moved on and those innovative projects are now legacy code. I’ll tell you about our journey, using neo4j &amp;amp; graphQL, towards supporting it all.
I joined the FT about 5 years ago, at around the time the organisation was moving away from a top down, centrally controlled, architect-driven software delivery approach, towards a far more democratised model.</description>

      <description>A agilidade trouxe para as equipe o foco em entrega de valor constantemente, em curtos espaços de tempo. Integrar desenvolvimento com operações é um grande passo. Mas como garantir entrega de valor? Nesse cenário, uma gestão efetiva do produto busca preencher esse gap.</description>

      <description>GitOps is gaining in popularity, yet some DevOps personnel are skeptical of the practice. This is because if done wrongly, it can cause havoc. Hence it is important to know what GitOps actually is, the right way to implement it and to build a healthy DevOps culture overall to facilitate it.</description>

A higher standard in the code we write, in how we interact with each other, in how we build technology together as humans. Leave knowing how we - every one of us - can lead the Open Source world together in a positive direction.</description>

      <description>Com a constante evolução da Infraestrutura tradicional se faz necessário não apenas a atualização dos ativos computacionais, mas também adotar novas metodologias que façam com que os recursos e serviços sejam provisionados, atualizados e entregues em menor tempo, permitindo escalabilidade e alta disponibilidade. Agora, imagine aplicar as práticas DevOps em uma infraestrutura tradicional no ambiente Militar, onde encontramos dificuldades já conhecidas e esperadas, e novas barreiras, muitas delas, culturais, impostas pelo meio.</description>

      <description>How Weedmaps transformed from going from Bi-Weekly releases to multiple releases a day and the various changes we made along the way. This talk will also offer other lessons learned along the way.
Topics to cover:
 Where we are now (multiple releases a day across 15+ projects) Where we were a few years ago (Bi-weekly releases/train/coordinated releases across less than 5 projects) Just because you are continuously releasing doesn’t mean that you’re practicing good Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployments Stopping the chaos How we reduced deployment times and improved MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery) Using Circle 2 Gathering Metrics and what to gather Standard metrics to measure Tools that we use to communicate across teams Improving Jira Tickets (3 Cs - Card/Conversation/Confirmation) Stickies are cool Moving notifications to Slack and pagerduty  </description>

This will include the pros-cons and high-lows we encountered in our journey while looking for a suitable workflow engine. How we added new things in existing technologies to make it fit for our environment and how user can learn from our mistakes and setup in your environment within hours.</description>

      <title>A Live Demonstration of Cloud IAM Misconfiguration Attacks</title>

      <guid>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2020-charlotte/program/josh-stella/</guid>
      <description>The cloud has changed the way hackers operate: Rather than targeting an organization and then searching for vulnerabilities to exploit, they now use automation to scan the internet looking for cloud misconfigurations to exploit, and then use IAM like a network to move laterally, find data, and extract it. We’ve graduated from simple misconfiguration mistakes to techniques bad actors are using today to breach data out from under the most advanced cloud security teams⁠—often without detection.</description>

      <description>With a variety of choices and a constantly changing landscape designing a lasting architecture is no easy task. Monolith style applications take a lot of criticism these days, but when starting a new project this is often the right choice. In the early stages we cannot anticipate the changes which will come, from a technical perspective or in terms of features and requirements. Microservices, serverless or the next latest trend may be turn out to be the solution we need, but this is rarely clear on day one.</description>

      <description>In this talk, I&amp;rsquo;m quickly introduction the concept of a Service Mesh and why it becomes so popular. Then, I&amp;rsquo;m explaining how Istio works and can be deployed across several public clouds to provide busting and disaster recovery capabilities. Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m doing a live demo showing a multi site deployment in action. In this demo, I deploy Istio on 2 Kubernetes clusters running in different regions. I simulate load and failures to share best practices about how to setup a global Service Mesh properly.</description>

      <description>Monitoring a monolithic application is a relatively simple job the Developer is responsible for. As applications become more service based, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to shift those responsibilities to an Infrastructure or DevOps team. This talk will walk through a checklist of a Well Monitored Application from a developer&amp;rsquo;s perspective.</description>

      <description>Challenge Most IT environments we deal with contain a great deal of information, logs, and metrics driven by tools such as: * SumoLogic * Splunk * DynaTrace * AppInsights * SCOM * PRTG * something built in-house…
These tools may be useful in isolation, but often results in substantial waste and distrust due to information not being shared between teams and departments. Furthermore, duplication of alerts may be sent by email, text or something else.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer who spends her time writing code and developing apps. I have a pretty good grasp of the vocabulary and technologies relevant to my job. But what happens when another facet of engineering, one that is gaining a lot of traction and has a large footprint of its own starts becoming more and more relevant to my day to day tasks? Well, that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what happened to me last year when DevOps became a big part of my role.</description>

      <description>Service Level Objectives (SLOs) can be a powerful construct for monitoring a service’s performance and informing when action must be taken to improve the service. Simple SLOs are the most effective but keeping SLOs simple is a challenge that requires iteration and deeper understanding of the service&amp;rsquo;s customers and architecture.
Learn how the Photos SREs at Google tackled that problem when defining an SLO for one key service, which was serving over a hundred customers like Google Drive and Google Photos all of whom have specific use cases and performance expectations.</description>

      <description>IT organizations that don’t know their risk factors and exposure are likely to make investments in DevOps that don’t matter. After working with several teams that lost their DevOps funding after making automation investments in areas that were not business constraints, Anne Hungate&amp;rsquo;s “Know Your Numbers” model emerged. Join Anne to learn how to prioritize your DevOps improvements and demonstrate the impact and value you are delivering. After all, DevOps gets traction and funding when teams can show the business impact of doing it, so if you want your DevOps initiative to take off, be prepared to provide some metrics!</description>

      <description>In this workshop, we&amp;rsquo;ll try out a fresh microservice choreography platform (open source and part of the CNCF), which sits on top of Kubernetes, and can create clusters, micro scale containers automatically. This is all done via Storyscript, a language for describing how data moves across services.
Think containers as being first class entities of the language, whose output can be interacted with as variables.
A quick example of Storyscript used to build a weather bot for Slack:</description>

      <description>Government Agencies and Commercial Organizations are rapidly adopting devops and cloud services. The advent of readily available automation services are transforming the way we respond to security and systems events at scale. As developers accelerate the pace and frequency of code deployments, the security and compliance teams must constantly play catch-up. The use of DevSecOps methodologies and technologies can help integrate security and compliance functions into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.</description>

      <title>Accidental DataOps: How we matured our organization with data, and how you can too!</title>

      <description>Usually, DataOps means applying DevOps principles to existing data analytics projects. We accidentally reversed it, taking a DevOps initiative and catalyzing adoption of data-driven practices across our company. You’ll leave inspired and equipped to improve your organization with ops data.
What started as a practical initiative to bring better reliability and visibility to our software product had the unexpected effect of catalyzing a transformation that helped our organization become more data-driven across the company.</description>

      <description>A strength of the tech industry is its ability to facilitate remote work. Remote work helps people — particularly those who are part of marginalized communities, such as folks who are undergoing a gender transition — and it can be a big factor when you’re trying to foster inclusive teams!</description>

      <description>After the Kubernetes cluster is stood up, Docker continuers are deployed, Jenkins jobs (or similar) are pushing code to production, your cloud app is humming along. Then, it happens: a new feature request.
Designers have long handed-off instructions for new features with only an image or two—static pictures that represent how the coded version should appear. That process is failing us. We don’t need to fire everyone and start over, and we need some new systems and structures to help our teams interact differently.</description>

      <description>I live in South London and a new local presenter to DevOpsdays London. I started my career in open systems and due to a HR error (no kidding) I was parachuted into a mainframe project where I was a developer for a while before getting back into the open systems. More recently over the last few years, I have started focusing more on enabling mainframe teams to adopt modern ways of working and this time out of my own interest.</description>

      <description>In my 14 years in the industry, I watched the technology landscape become more and more complex, with new tools and methodologies emerging and fading away every year. Yet I see &amp;ldquo;thought leaders&amp;rdquo; get up on stage every day, promising they can teach you the 3 easy steps to:
 Achieve full software testability (a subset of the Halting Problem, which is undecidable) Remediate 20 years of legacy code Migrate your entire data center to the cloud Adopt the new architectural pattern that is going to solve all of your problems  Beyond fostering imposter syndrome and burnout, this isn&amp;rsquo;t good for business.</description>

      <description>Docker&amp;rsquo;s slogan is &amp;lsquo;Build, Ship And Run Any App Anywhere&amp;rsquo;, but in the last couple of years the &amp;lsquo;build&amp;rsquo; part seems to have stagnated. That all changed with the release of buildkit, which is now part of Docker 19.03. During this talk Adrian will share with you a tour through the new tooling and show how it can be used to improve the development build cycle.</description>

      <description>Prerequisite Have a recent (v2.20.0 or greater) version of Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads) already installed on your machine. If you use Windows, make sure that you can use Git either from Git Bash (that is part of Git for Windows), Windows Subsystem for Linux, a Linux virtual machine, or cygwin, as you will need an sh compatible shell.
Objectives This workshop is about learning some advanced Git commands and options by trying and discussing them.</description>

      <description>Agile has revolutionized development work, but operational work has often struggled to adapted itself to an agile model. Let&amp;rsquo;s step back and see what we are trying to accomplish, and see how several implementations I&amp;rsquo;ve been apart of both succeeded and fell short. Hopefully your team will gain new perspectives to continue the agile conversation.</description>

      <title>Agile transformation patterns that are being repeated in DevOps transformations</title>
      <link>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-raleigh/program/adam-lefkowitz/</link>

      <description>In 2001, a group of software engineers introduced the Agile Manifesto to help teams adopt a more lightweight software development process. Most organizations were riding the Agile wave through some form of transformation by the late 2000s. Many of these transformations stalled out and were fraught with challenges.
As we head into 2020, the DevOps wave is in full effect and many organizations are falling prey to some of the same patterns that thwarted Agile transformations.</description>

      <title>AIOps Is How We Will Survive DevOps</title>

      <description>Guessing alert threshold settings, coping with event storms, and scanning logs for root cause analysis at 2am is inefficient and soul-crushing. This session uses Marco’s experiences to give a reality-check on AI/ML, list what DevOps missed out on, and why he sees AIOps as the natural next step.
DevOps took us from SysAdmins to DeployAdmins to improve availability but came with a tidal wave of tools and environments, leaving detecting anomalies and finding root cause a task for the overcrowded war-room of siloed experts.</description>

      <description>AIOps is one of the most promising fields where machine learning and in particular deep learning is starting to play an increasingly dominant role. Besides streamlining different tasks, machine learning algorithms are able to give additional insights into complex business processes, which most often cannot be maintained anymore by a human being without automation. One of the reasons is the number of interdependent system components which interact with each other in order to fulfil a certain task.</description>

      <title>AIOps: Observability &#43; Machine Learning &#43; Automate Everything You Can</title>

      <description>“See Problems as They Occur” is the 1st Principle of Feedback in the DevOps Handbook. Reducing operational risk, seeing problems as they occur, and continuously improving IT systems and applications requires making them Observable. But achieving Observability means generating more data than people can reasonably handle. How can we enhance visibility when there is just too much we need to see? Enter the DevOps mantra, “Automate Everything You Can”!
In this session, we will delve into AIOps as the answer to the Observability dilemma.</description>

      <description>At Babylon Health, we are on a mission to put accessible and affordable healthcare in the hands of every person on Earth. You might imagine that such an endeavour would generate incredible amounts of data! And, since AI is in the core of our product, leveraging data from our microservices and clients is crucial to our success. So we set off to build a data platform of the future, based both in AWS and GCP, leveraging our existing infrastructure and CICD and building the missing parts.</description>

      <title>Aligned autonomy: How clarity on outcomes gets us to self-organized teams that win</title>

      <description>Product vision gives teams alignment:: something to long for and drive towards. And it also enables them to actually get there in a truly autonomous fashion. Once teams understand and align in the vision, they can self-organize to determine how to best achieve it. While product vision is long-term and lofty, it is also aligned and internally consistent. That means that it can be further divided into smaller, meaningful outcomes that help make that vision a reality.</description>

      <description>Keeping up with the rate of change in the technology landscape is hard and attending local Meetups are often the best, easiest, and most cost-effective way to learn and interact with people who are trying to solve the same problems as you. They’re also a great way to socialise with people with similar interests.
However, going to these events can be a daunting ordeal. In particular if you’ve just moved to the city, don’t have anyone to go with, or feel like you don’t ‘belong’ at a certain group because you haven’t used a certain technology yet.</description>

      <description>XKCD describes itself as &amp;ldquo;a webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language.&amp;rdquo; What if it is more? What if XKCD and its creator Randall Munroe have slowly been revealing what software development, DevOps and team collaboration are all about.
In this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at some recurring themes in XKCD comics - and how they hit home with recurring themes in DevOps. From regular expressions, vim vs. emacs to user experiences so bad&amp;hellip;they are literally a joke XKCD finds ways to express simply the thoughts we&amp;rsquo;ve all had.</description>

      <description>We all spend a lot of energy trying to discover tech debt, and eliminate it. Fat chance! In this talk, I will convince you that all tech is debt, and that it’s futile to try to live debt-free. Why? Because none of your tech is an asset; it’s all liability. From the minute it’s created, it’s already old. It has security vulnerabilities. It’s not idiomatic to whatever the latest trends are.</description>

      <title>All The World’s A Staging Server</title>

      <description>I have sad news - staging is a lie and will never be identical to production, because production is unknowable. Trying to replicate it is often prohibitively expensive.
But I also have good news - production can contain multitudes, including features you aren’t ready to turn on or activate yet. You can hide in the dark and do integration testing at the same time.
It&amp;rsquo;s simplistic to say that you should just kill the idea of a staging server and do everything in production.</description>

      <description>No Nubank há um conjunto de microsserviços classificados como horizontais - aqueles que, assim como o serviço de envio de emails, são usados por diversos squads. Porém, por serem usados por muitos times, não eram realmente cuidados por nenhum e por isso acabaram abandonados, se tornando instáveis e perdendo sua confiabilidade.
Para resolver este problema, o Nubank decidiu criar um time especializado em serviços horizontais que os adotaria e daria a eles toda a atenção necessária para que se tornassem confiáveis novamente.</description>

      <description>As organisations look to empower engineers more, and embrace devops practices, we have seen the support role change quite a bit too. Developers are moving from being purely third line support, to working more collaboratively with engineers and operational staff. Also as we move to cloud native microservice solutions, the increased complexity and diversity of our production landscape means operational staff may well rely more heavily on the engineers, in particular out of hours.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 2am. You&amp;rsquo;re woken up by your pager app. The site is up, but it&amp;rsquo;s behaving&amp;hellip; strangely. Maybe a service is writing corrupted data. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s running slowly, or pausing at random. These &amp;ldquo;unknown unknowns&amp;rdquo; are some of the hardest problems in production engineering. There&amp;rsquo;s no run book for this and your logs can&amp;rsquo;t save you now!
We can reach for Extended Berkeley Packet Filters (eBPF) when we need powerful tools for getting deep insights into applications running live in production, without impacting performance or availability.</description>

      <description>Hay estrategias de despliegue como blue/green deployment y rolling updates que nos ayudarán a conseguir algo muy interesante: despliegues sin parada. Sin embargo, ahí no acaba todo, ya que disponemos de estrategias adicionales que nos permitirán cubrir otros escenarios, como despliegues controlados a diferentes grupos de usuarios o despliegues que nos permitan testar en producción nuevas versiones, de modo que aseguremos performance y otras métricas.
¿Quieres conocer dichas estrategias? ¿Aún no sabes que es canary deployment o un deployment ring?</description>

      <description>APIs are the backbone of our web and mobile platforms today. They literally run the world, yet we don’t monitor them properly. Traditional approaches to monitoring have focused too much on performance and ping tests. That approach has proven to be highly unreliable, failing to alert teams when an API is not functioning correctly. Now, with more and faster releases thanks to agile, the problem of unreliable APIs is becoming worse.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how to transform IT systems into reusable assets that are consumable in a self service fashion via APIs — and the cultural shift that needs to happen inside the organization towards a mindset of openness and cross-functional collaboration.</description>

      <description>Desenvolver para sistemas embarcados para muitos é algo problemático, dado que a maior parte do tempo (além do desenvolvimento) é usada para testar. Para tornar esse processo mais rápido e confiável é possível aplicar técnicas e ferramentas de Integração Contínua, e é disso que vamos falar um pouco.
Desenvolver aplicações para sistemas embarcados pode se tornar algo complicado e demorado para os desenvolvedores, pelo mais variados motivos (e.g: portabilidade, bibliotecas, recursos de hardware, software) e com isso é necessário boa parte do tempo na realização de testes, seja de software ou de hardware.</description>

      <description>Esse trabalho nasceu como trabalho de conclusão da minha pós-graduação, em Qualidade em Teste de Software. Tendo em vista que o objetivo do trabalho era falar sobre qualidade, o Sistema Toyota foi escolhido em virtude de ser um sistema orientado a redução de desperdício e entregas de alta qualidade. Além de focar fortemente na questão de automação por meio do Jidoka.
Assim sendo, em um primeiro momento a apresentação irá abordar a aplicação de ferramentas do Sistema Toyota em uma empresa de desenvolvimento de software durante 3 sprints.</description>

      <description>Leading Agile and DevOps during the past 3 years at Amdocs, 27,000 employees company, made me realize that in big and complex organization relatively small issues are often not quite easy to solve. I learnt that sometimes in order to solve complex problems we can look for solutions on other disciplines.
I understood that behavior is not a result of managerial instructions and not driven by the nice slogans written on the company walls.</description>

      <description>As product manager for compute, storage and network capacity delivery for Spotify world-wide, procurement of that capacity was one of the major products, especially timely procurement of capacity to cope with on-going global growth.
During this talk I&amp;rsquo;ll share experience on how we build a multi-functional team responsible for buying datacenter space, network/storage/compute capacity that incorporated legal, finance, engineering and commercial aspects of procurement. And how the mission of that team changed when Spotify moved to Google Cloud Platform.</description>

      <description>Shift Left is a mind shift to test earlier in the development life cycle. A Shift Left strategy, enables teams to realize outcomes such as higher quality applications, creating faster feedback loops and more confidence making changes to their application. It&amp;rsquo;s about evolving the culture within the agile team which will lead to success in achieving continuous delivery.</description>

      <description>Debates about what technologies are or aren’t serverless are endless and tiresome. The term is now applied to products that require the operator to run their own clusters or manage installations of FaaS platforms. The buzzwordy nature of the term and its overuse obscures a deeper truth: serverless has never been about technologies. Instead, it’s an approach to development that focuses on delivering business value and minimizing total cost of ownership.</description>

      <title>Approaching Overload: Diagnosis and Response to Anomalies in Web Production Systems</title>

      <description>Web production software systems operate at an unprecedented scale today, requiring extensive automation to develop and maintain services. The systems are designed to regularly adapt to dynamic load to avoid the consequences of overloading portions of the network. As the software systems scale and complexity grows, it becomes more difficult to observe, model, and track how the systems function and malfunction. Anomalies inevitably arise, challenging incident responders or SREs to recognize and understand unusual behaviors as they plan and execute interventions to mitigate or resolve the threat of service outages.</description>

      <description>Technology is fast moving, and devops tools pop up like wildfire. Teams are desperate to solve their problems &amp;amp; often make implementation decisions based on word of mouth, “kick the tires” syndrome or superficial evaluations. In some cases we justify our stack decisions based on project/sprint deadlines, the product’s marketing materials, occasionally, the README files. Really scary stuff!
In this talk I’ll explore how &amp;amp; why teams are easily lulled into believing that shiny objects will independently solve their stack deficiencies.</description>

Rather than quipping at one-another (like UDP), there is a technique for resolving disputes or conflicts that is more akin to TCP. It is called &amp;ldquo;Active Listening&amp;rdquo;. In this lightning talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how this technique reduces the likelihood of a shouting match by drastically slows the escalation, and forcing each side to listen and comprehend what the other person is trying to say.</description>

In this lightning talk, I’ll show you how this technique reduces the likelihood of a shouting match by drastically slows the escalation, and forcing each side to listen and comprehend what the other person is trying to say.</description>

      <title>Around &amp; After Kubernetes: The Principles and Ideas that Guide Us</title>
      <link>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-cape-town/program/kingori-maina/</link>

      <guid>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-cape-town/program/kingori-maina/</guid>
      <description>We made the decision in late 2015 to move all our applications to containerised environments managed by Kubernetes. It took roughly 3 years to complete that migration. During that journey we’ve learnt a lot about containerisation, distributed systems, complicated migrations and automation of systems managing over 70 developers. We think our migration has been a success and we’re keen to share a little a bit about what we know.
This talk is about sharing some of the key principles and ideas that guide us.</description>

      <description>A arquitetura baseada em microserviços resulta em muitos benefícios no processo de desenvolvimento de software. Porém, se não for bem avaliada e gerenciada, pode trazer muitas dores de cabeça (nem sempre relacionados à tecnologia) que podem atrasar a entrega e gerar produtos inacabados.
Serão avaliadas nesta talk a relação entre cultura de desenvolvimento e microserviços, gerenciamento, ownership dos serviços e se Arquitetura Orientada à Microserviços é realmente o que você precisa - e se realmente é uma bala de prata.</description>

Agile helped us eliminate slow, waterfall development and validation cycles. DevOps helped us close the delivery gap. And the global pandemic of 2020 forced our teams to deliver value and to stay connected to business and customers while in different locations at different times.</description>

      <description>The new interest in the ideas surrounding blameless retrospective culture and examining the deep role human factors play in our work is changing the way the technology industry understands and responds to service-impacting incidents.
But what would happen if we took these ideas to traffic court? Would they be as understanding about this type of &amp;ldquo;incident&amp;rdquo; as we strive to be about ours? And just which modern incident analysis techniques might be useful in traffic court?</description>

      <description>Auditors want proof that the right people did what they were supposed to do, when they were supposed to do it, and they want that information on demand. Developers tend to run for cover whenever release managers show up with an audit request in their hands. Audit-ready pipelines aim to address both of these problems.
The idea behind audit-ready pipelines stems from trying to merge software delivery automation, CI, and CD together into something where you can get increased visibility and understanding of your entire process, and what it means to different stakeholders.</description>

En la charla veremos desde como empezar con Inspec hasta como podemos integrar estos tests dentro de nuestros pipelines CI/CD, asegurando que siempre que desplegamos nuestra infraestructura se cumplen las mejores prácticas y recomendaciones se seguridad en nuestra infraestructura.</description>

      <description>Nuestro problema era el siguiente: DevOps se estaba transformando en el cuello de botella, ya que no podíamos manejar la creación de los proyectos en Jenkins a la velocidad deseada.
Utilizar Jenkinsfiles no es suficiente, aunque sí bastante útil: permite replicación, conservar un histórico y aplicar cambios por ramas, pero nuestros desarrolladores crean proyectos para librerías como repositorios o como directorios dentro de otros repositorios&amp;hellip; ¿Cómo lidiar con todo esto?</description>

      <description>What do you do when you start with just 3 databases, 4 test envs, and a handful of developers, and now you have over 100 databases, 80+ environments, and 100+ developers? How do you keep up with all of that change? How do you keep everything in sync? Let’s walk through what we tried, tested, and eventually went with. We have over 3000 databases across 80+ environments, keeping everything configured correctly, keeping the databases in sync, and designing it all to allow us to continue to grow has been an adventure.</description>

      <description>What if you were a wizard who could bend the entire world to your will? Although technology is forever evolving, there is still a huge gap between what people think can be automated and the reality that most things can be. Hundreds of different steps can be automated and even more programs exist to help you do it. Some are easier than others, some ask for more flexibility, and some are really tough to accomplish.</description>

      <description>Finding a proper balance between classic IT Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) and modern technologies initiatives has been a reasonably difficult process for most large enterprises. The classic enterprise risk policy profiles are often redundant, misaligned, or in some cases outdated.
In this presentation, we are going to discuss two recently published papers that address modern patterns to deal with the imbalance. The first paper was introduced in September of 2019 called “DevOps Automated Governance Reference Architecture”.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes scales and manages stateless applications quite easily, but stateful applications can require more work. Databases, caching systems, and file stores are harder to dynamically manage with data intact, and sometimes come with their own notion of clustering. Operators are Kubernetes agents that know how to deploy, scale, manage, backup, and even upgrade complex, stateful applications.
This talk provides an overview of the Operator pattern introduced by CoreOS, adopted by many community projects like Rook, Prometheus, and others, and supported by the release of the Operator Framework by Red Hat.</description>

      <description>This workshop will discuss using Open Policy Agent to create admissions controllers in Kubernetes to enforce security, resource, and compliance policies as well as provide an example for simplifying some operational pains like external secrets retrieval. By the end of the workshop, participants will be more aware of problems that come with increased Kubernetes adoption as well as potential solutions for how to solve these problems. This workshop will focus on the user experience of both a cluster administrator and an applications developer as well as how both of their goals can be addressed by adopting these patterns.</description>

      <description>If you’re like 70% of continuous integration and delivery users out there, you’re using Jenkins, the powerful and popular automation server. Jenkins runs on many different operating systems, and can build and deploy applications in a variety of languages, across many different platforms. Almost no matter where you are in your automation maturity, there’s always another level to reach: if you’re using the basic point-and-click of freestyle jobs, you can move to the scripted context of pipelines.</description>

      <description>Secrets are a key pillar of Kubernetes’ security model, used internally (e.g. service accounts) and by users (e.g. API keys), but did you know they are stored in plaintext? That’s right, by default all Kubernetes secrets are base64 encoded and stored as plaintext in etcd. Anyone with access to the etcd cluster has access to all your Kubernetes secrets.
Thankfully there are better ways. This lecture provides an overview of different techniques for more securely managing secrets in Kubernetes including secrets encryption, KMS plugins, and tools like HashiCorp Vault.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes in general, and Istio in particular, have changed a lot the way we look at Ops-related constraints: monitoring, load-balancing, health checks, etc. Before those products became available, there were already available solutions to handle those constraints.
Among them is Hystrix, a Java library provided by Netflix. From the site: “Hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable.</description>

      <title>Becoming antifragile is more important than ever in disruptive times</title>

      <description>Have you ever wondered why DevOps, Continuous Deployment, canary releases, microservices, chaos engineering and reducing Technical Debt work so well? Why it works at all? These and many other concepts all have one thing in common. They are affected by a hidden force: antifragility.
The word ‘antifragile’ did not exist until 2012 when Nassim Nicholas Taleb published his book titled ‘Antifragile, things that gain from disorder’. He defines antifragility as ‘anything that has more upside than downside from random events and shocks’.</description>

      <description>The always-on, always-available expectations of digital services have increased the requirements of technical teams to provide response and readiness around the clock. For teams new to this concept, introducing on-call ownership can be difficult and complex. On-call management is key to supporting reliable services, and the non-technical aspects are important for teams to consider. This talk will cover the organizational practices that will help your team transition to on-call responders and build a supportive response culture.</description>

      <description>Surprisingly, implementing a secure, robust and fast promotion pipelines for container images is not as easy as it might sound. Automating dependency resolution (base images), implementing multiple registries for different maturity stages and making sure that we actually run in production containers from the images we intended can be tricky. In this talk, we will compare different approaches, compile a wish-list of features and create a pipeline that checks all the boxes using free and open-source tools.</description>

      <description>Here’s the step that most people miss when documenting their product or process: they fail to empathize with their audience, and this leads them to either write the wrong doc or hide the right information somewhere their users will never find. Instead of saying “What do I know about this topic?” and writing that down in a blob, you should say “What does my customer/user/team want to know?” It’s a simple shift in perspective that will make your docs wildly more useful and easier to navigate.</description>

      <description>My first contact with kubernetes was by the end of 2015, more because of Go than the clunky orchestration system. At the time my company was looking to a PaaS that could help ease the life of our developers and after trying mostly everything we’ve decided to start a project called Teresa to create an abstraction over k8s. Turns out that implementing and maintaining kubernetes can become a full time time job that never ends - the very thing that ops complain about devs.</description>

      <guid>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2020-houston/program/dan-zentgraf/</guid>
      <description>There is a deep gap between the common understanding of how to best implement CI/CD and the technological needs of driving changes into a database. Whether this gap exists due to a lack of time to focus, a lack of knowledge, or both, it is very real and can be seen in the mismatch between the speed and maturity of application change delivery relative to database change delivery.
While CI/CD principles are perfectly applicable to database changes, the hard part is finding a realistic way to actually apply them to the very stateful, ‘high gravity’ databases.</description>

      <description>DevOps practices have had a huge positive impact on teamwork. However, the DevOps paradigm is primarily focused on the more technical aspects of delivering value as a team. What about collaboration and communication outside agile teams? All too often, business stakeholders are abruptly involved in the development process, and business requirements get lost in translation. As a consequence, the solution provided by the development team hardly addresses the need of the business, and little value is delivered.</description>

      <description>Too much design up front and you are bumping into the design all of the time (and losing time). Not enough design and your system can crumble in reality. How do you blend architecture so you have the right decisions at the right time, and give them enough due dilligence? How do you embrace cloud and microservices and not risk getting into different failure scenarios or overly complicated maintenance and ripple effects?</description>

By saving the day, we avert disaster, win the contract, make the sale - but what else is going on deeper down, and why is it so common for us to not even realize we are choosing this path?</description>

      <description>In 2018 we did research at NTNU Trondheim about DevOps and security. We conducted in-depth interviews with industry professionals to find out what the state of secure DevOps was in the Norwegian IT industry. First and foremost, we uncovered a divide between security professionals and developers. Some developers referred to security guidelines as propaganda and talked about how security gets in the way of their work. At the same time, we interviewed representatives from organisations where security was an integral part of the development process.</description>

      <description>Data science teams live in their own specialized world, working with data, running experiments, and building great models. The software deployment teams that take those models and use them to power production applications have a completely different focus and set of trusted tools.
How can we bring both the worlds together in order to effectively deploy and scale ML models?
In this talk, we will discuss ways to bring DevOps maturity and processes for AI/ML model management and operations through;</description>

      <description>We’re running multiple Kubernetes cluster, every with its own Prometheus instance. When more and more teams and services joined these clusters, it became cumbersome to manage Prometheus alert configuration for their services manually. So we’re using a sidecar container that watches ConfigMap changes across the cluster and dynamically add, modify or remove alerts in the Prometheus instance. In this talk it will be shown how to configure a Prometheus Helm release and how a ConfigMap has to look like to achieve the product team alert self-service.</description>

      <description>At George Floyd Square on the intersection of 38th and Chicago, we tell people &amp;ldquo;Bring your gifts&amp;rdquo; when people ask how they can help. Everyone has different skills and resources. Bring yours.
At the intersection of dev and ops, our work concerns human questions as much as technological ones. We’re here to break down silos, to build better systems. That work doesn’t end at work.
Here in MSP, the last year has been a case study, with proofs of concept that have real-world impact.</description>

      <description>Most teams find it hard to &amp;ldquo;do DevOps&amp;rdquo; in the DB for several reasons. This talk summarizes what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned over the last decade, studying teams that succeeded as well as those that tried. I&amp;rsquo;ve distilled it all into concrete, practical steps you can take to improve.
Databases are special because they&amp;rsquo;re stateful, and DevOps reflects this: in practice, databases are a lot harder to &amp;ldquo;DevOps&amp;rdquo; (as a verb) than other parts of the stack.</description>

      <description>With the advent of the DevOps movement we have seen an immense improvement in software delivery by closely linking software engineering with deployment and infrastructure. We have also seen an increase in complexity of options: what is needed for one organisation is not what another organisation requires or can even stomach. In fact, our experience from numerous DevOps transformation projects shows that we need to consider aspects of DevOps as strategic organisational assets, and in turn, must treat them as we would a product.</description>

      <description>The cloud makes it easier and quicker to provision infrastructure at scale, but there is added complexity with that scale. By bringing practices from software development like test driven development, automated testing, and continuous integration/deployment to manage complexity at each stage of the pipeline, you can build and manage your cloud resources more effectively, consistently, and more securely.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes is being adopted as the de-facto container orchestration platform by enterprises all across. Several open source technologies are being built around kubernetes. Serverless and CI/CD are also becoming Kubernetes-native. But stitching together these solutions involves some good amount of work and getting all these enabled to run in your datacenter is a much bigger challenge.
OpenShift is a fully open source enterprise-ready Kubernetes implementation that brings technologies needed to containerize and cloud enable enterprise data centers into a single platform.</description>

      <description>DevOps is an important part of every tech organization, it is an enabler for creativity and productivity. Like many enabling technologies, DevOps is great when it just works. Developers and product manager should treat DevOps like running water or electricity - think about it as a transparent layer that empowers the business. In this talk Amir Shevat, an ex-Amazon and Google executive, will talk about how his startup is trying to build such a transparent DevOps layer, the technical and product challenges they faced, the architecture decisions that had to be made, and the learnings they had.</description>

      <guid>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-boston/program/richard-boyd/</guid>
      <description>Starting with an empty code repository, we will build an entire CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, deploys, tests, reverts (hopefully not), and tests your code in production. During this workshop we will incrementally build this infrastructure utilizing cloudformation and attendees will walk away with a set of templates they can take to their friends to show them the light that devops provides. Once the pipeline is set up, a developer needs only to commit their changes and the aws-managed services will handle building, testing, deploying, and monitoring the change.</description>

      <description>Logs are a critical part of any system, they give you deep insights about your application, what your system is doing and what caused the error, when something wrong happens. Virtually, every system generates logs in some form or another and these logs are written somewhere, probably, to files on local disks. When you&amp;rsquo;re building large scale applications, your system goes to multiple hosts and managing the logs across multiple hosts can be complicated.</description>

      <description>Teams considering adoption of service-based or microservice architectures have a wealth of information to consult on the organization and design of application software, the benefits of these architectural approaches, and general considerations for the prerequisites. Even if you’re not ready to adopt a microservices architecture, you still want the benefits of rapidly deployable, highly automated infrastructure that enables rapid delivery of new features and services.
What can you do to build an infrastructure that supports such mythical delivery?</description>

      <description>Building an inclusive culture takes work. What is an inclusive culture? How do we go about building a welcoming environment where all can thrive at work? While there are many answers to these questions, Erin postulates that building an inclusive culture can be done, in part, by leveling up your team’s DevOps processes.
We will walk through tools Erin’s team used to both improve their DevOps processes and create an environment where everyone is setup for success.</description>

      <description>How would you build a team from scratch? What techniques would you use? What metrics should you respond to?
In this talk you’ll see how we assembled a team, embedded agile values, a DevOps mindset and a clear purpose to create a squad with an infectious, high performing culture. We’ll demonstrate the coaching and visualisation techniques we used to reduce batch size and improve quality. You’ll see how to reveal ‘hidden’ product backlogs, make the invisible visible, and use domain driven design, theory of constraints and language to optimise team resilience.</description>

      <title>Building Cost Visibility For Your Kubernetes Clusters</title>

      <guid>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-vancouver/program/garland-kan/</guid>
      <description>This talk addresses one of the most common challenges for organizations adopting Kubernetes at scale: understanding how you’re spending money in your k8s clusters. The inherent sharing nature of Kubernetes means that you have no visibility into how much stuff costs. Without this cost visibility, you can’t optimize your cluster utilization and cut costs, forecast budgets accurately, or understand your product margins in multi-tenancy situations.
Cloud providers like AWS and GCP don’t tell you how you’re spending money at the application-level.</description>

      <description>Machine Learning Researchers develop code, as DevOps engineers use public transport – just as a means to get to what they have to do.
With Machine Learning coming more prominent in enterprises, academics are coming into a new space without having any sort of DevOps mindset when it comes to developing products.
Join me in as I walk through how we can transform an academic research focused mindset to adopt DevOps principles with tools, techniques, and accountability.</description>

      <description>Building distributed systems is notoriously hard … building a distributed team, even more so. At Elastic - the company behind Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash - everything is distributed; the company and our products. This talk dives into the details of how Elastic is thriving on its distributed model:
 How Elastic started to be distributed by design? What our shared values are and what we have learned as we progressed and grew to our current size?</description>

      <description>The most difficult part of putting in place effective DevOps or Agile practices is building great teams. Many studies have shown that building great teams is partially about building patterns of communication and discovery, and partially about growing individuals in their careers. Experience has shown me that there are some things that leaders and individual contributors can do to nurture great teams, and some things that will stop teams from functioning.</description>

      <description>Creating Operators is the most versatile way to manage applications running on top of Kubernetes. Is it a bad idea to write one using Java instead of Go? Java is no dinosaur as many like to think - the language has been revamped in recent years and the runtime is rapidly improving. It also has a first-class Kubernetes SDK and thousands of development teams for whom it is the primary language.</description>

      <description>Networking with other professionals is an important part of everyone’s career as it allow for creating mutually beneficial and meaningful professional connections. But, it can be overwhelming to attend a conference, prospective client meeting or a public event and try to connect with others. The ability to network successfully seems to be a dark art that a handful of people know or an inherent skill that only certain types of people possess.</description>

      <description>N26 has a mission: To build the bank the world loves to use. While we’re currently live in countless countries in the EU, we plan on launching in the US later this year, and also have immediate plans for Brazil and beyond. With every market launch comes a multiplier in complexity in our infrastructure, including configuration management, pipeline modifications, and application provisioning. In a company that’s witnessing rapid growth and change, how does N26 manage to separate these concerns and allow teams to be autonomous as possible, while also ensuring the reliability and consistency to our deployments to all regions?</description>

      <description>At PlaceExchange—a programmatic ad exchange for out of home media—we have architected a system that begins in remote, IoT devices stationed next to freeways or on the interior of subway stations and ends with workers handling messages from asynchronous queues for data ETL processing.
In this session, I’ll share the key decisions we made when provisioning each stage of our infrastructure, from configuring multiple IoT clients on the frontend to the backend systems that ingest and process the data provided.</description>

      <description>Secrets are everywhere&amp;hellip;from your Facebook account to your bank account. In DevOps managing secrets is an enormous task that if not done properly risks the security of your project and the reputation of your company. The advent of cloud computing and the dynamic creation of large numbers of servers and services that all requiring secrets has made the task Herculean.
We&amp;rsquo;ll talk about how we can use an identity provider such as AWS IAM or Azure IAM and along with Hashicorp Vault and how they can be used to dynamically generate secrets that then expire after the work is done they were created to perform.</description>

      <description>The relationship between business and IT has always been a source of concern. Business people blame IT people of speaking techno-babble, being bureaucratic and slow, and not having a clue of business needs. In turn, IT people accuse business people of never knowing what they want, always changing their minds, and blaming IT when it’s their own fault. Learn about constructive behaviour that each party would like the other party to exhibit.</description>

      <title>Can a DevOps culture help avoid burnout?</title>

      <description>Clinical burnout has several causes. Chief among them are things like absence of fairness and a feeling of being ineffective in what we&amp;rsquo;re doing.
In this talk I&amp;rsquo;ll cover some of those well accepted causes of burnout and talk about how a culture of shared ownership and responsibility will help avoid many of them.
I&amp;rsquo;ll also cover how adding new need to learn some fancy new tool and changing someone&amp;rsquo;s title to &amp;ldquo;DevOps Engineer&amp;rdquo; is more likely to make it worse.</description>

      <description>Of course the answer to the question in the title is &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; because this twenty-year old multidisciplinary field is as broad and deep as Distributed Systems. Bringing perspectives, methods, and concepts from Resilience Engineering is a long game; my goal is to whet your appetite and lay down enough compelling threads for you to pull on as this important long game unfolds.</description>

      <description>Over the years the word devops lost it&amp;rsquo;s meaning at least it&amp;rsquo;s original meaning. The real challenge for the next decade will be to see how we can revive those original values and ideas, if at all&amp;hellip; This talk will give you some Ideas about that.</description>

      <description>O Kubernetes suporta algumas técnicas de Deploy nativas,mas nenhuma delas dá o poder e abre tantas possibilidades como o Istio faz.Nessa talk falarei como fazer Canary Release utilizando Istio, entenderemos sua arquitetura e entraremos em tópicos como gerenciamento de tráfego, fault injection e mais.
Com o estabelecimento do Kubernetes como padrão de fato para orquestração de containers e a adoção da arquitetura de micro-serviços ganhando cada dia mais adeptos, tópicos como: Estratégias de Deploy, Gerenciamento de tráfego, Observabilidade, Segurança, Fault Injection, e ainda outros, entraram no radar de indivíduos e empresa que estão enfrentando os desafios de gerenciar uma grande quantidade de micro-serviços em produção.</description>

      <description>The devopsdays Chattanooga organizers have decided to cancel the devopsdays Chattanooga event for 2020. We did not take this decision lightly, and spent quite a bit of time discussing whether or not to hold this year&amp;rsquo;s event. However, our attendees&#39;, speakers&#39; and organizers&#39; health and well-being are our top priority and for that reason, we made the decision to cancel.
We also discussed the possibility of making the event a virtual one, or doing an event during the spring, but felt like postponing the event until November 2021 would be the best option.</description>

      <description>With a heavy heart, the organizers of Eindhoven would like to inform you that we have - at this time - decided to cancel devopsdays Eindhoven for 2020. We did not take this decision lightly, and we took a large number of variables into account. However, ultimately, the health and well-being of all of our attendees, speakers and organizers are our top priority.
What does this mean for you? For our attendees that have already bought tickets for the events, we will - of course - be fully refunding your purchase.</description>

      <title>CAP Theorem: not what we thought it was, not what we are looking for</title>

      <description>The CAP theorem is often used to classify distributed systems, and the &amp;ldquo;two out of three&amp;rdquo; rule is often quoted. But the CAP theorem is widely misunderstood. What are the exact terms of the CAP Theorem? How does it differ from Brewer&amp;rsquo;s original CAP Conjecture? Where does CAP fall short of meeting practical engineering expectations?
Let us review the definitions and proof of the CAP Theorem, see some hidden assumptions, and attempt to apply these to modern distributed systems.</description>

      <description>“Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives.” – Charlie Munger. The most valuable asset of any organization is unarguably, its people. And all these people, being human, are motivated by what intrinsically drives them. By understanding this drive and targeting an incentive structure that brings harmony to the professional satisfaction of the employees as well as the objectives of the company, we can achieve a win-win situation.</description>

Agile and DevOps is not just about speed - it’s also about results for the business, and that implies delivery quality built into the process. A company only establishes itself in the market when they offer good levels of quality, scalability, capacity and availability.</description>

      <description>Tão importante como manter um sistema operante é verificar a saúde do mesmo. Com um ferramenta de APM (Monitoramento de Performance de Aplicação) você pode identificar em tempo real onde sua aplicação pode estar sendo menos performática, e de posse desses indicadores tomar ações mais assertivas em tratá-las, desta forma você economizará tempo e esforço da sua equipe e garantirá uma melhor experiência para seu cliente final.</description>

      <description>Most organizations feel the need to centralize their logs — once you have more than a couple of servers or containers, SSH and tail will not serve you well any more. However, the common question or struggle is how to achieve that.
This talk presents multiple approaches and patterns with their advantages and disadvantages, so you can pick the one that fits your organization best:
 Parse: Take the log files of your applications and extract the relevant pieces of information.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately, rolling out changes for humans is not as easy as merging a pull request. How many times have you seen a new project management tool get rolled out, sometimes with much fanfare and polish, and just not get adopted? Have you ever seen your company announce a new business unit which led to a minor revolt? How scary is the word “reorganization”? If you have ideas on how your group’s processes could be better, want to launch a new tool that will work better as your company grows, or have to adjust the way you do things to meet new regulations, learning the basics of change management will help you to get your plans going, launch them effectively, and ensure they stick around.</description>

      <description>Applications built over the years carry historical design assumptions, such as: it is acceptable to take a system out for upgrade maintenance for a few hours every 6 months.
In today’s world, embracing continuous delivery practices means more frequent releases, which means more downtime. Besides, finding a good maintenance window becomes a struggle with worldwide users, as well as for the operators managing the upgrade out of business hours.
In this talk, I want to demonstrate that by mapping out complex deployments processes, it becomes possible to prioritise work and progressively reduce the deployment impact.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Applications built over the years carry historical design assumptions, such as: it is acceptable to take a system out for upgrade maintenance for a few hours every 6 months.
In today’s world, embracing continuous delivery practices means more frequent releases, which means more downtime. Besides, finding a good maintenance window becomes a struggle with worldwide users, as well as for the operators managing the upgrade out of business hours.
In this talk, I demonstrate that by mapping out complex deployments processes, it becomes possible to prioritise work and progressively reduce the deployment impact.</description>

      <description>Before a car can be sold, it must be crash tested to assess its safety and resilience. Chaos engineering is a method for testing software in the same way. This talk explores the similarities between crash testing and chaos engineering and why the latter should be part of every engineer’s toolbox.
Chaos engineering refers to a practice that is common in many industries but still new to the software world: testing a product under degraded conditions to ensure that the impact of the condition is both known and contained.</description>

      <description>Chaos engineering is a disciplined approach to identifying failures before they become outages. By proactively testing how a system responds under stress, you can identify and fix failures before they end up in the news. Chaos engineering lets you compare what you think will happen to what actually happens in your systems. You literally break things on purpose to learn how to build more resilient systems.
In this session, Tammy leads a walk‑through of network chaos engineering, covering the tools and practices you need to implement chaos engineering in your organization.</description>

      <description>In DevOps we try to balance the development speed with risk. We may be able to detect when things go wrong, but how do we handle risky deployments when things do go wrong? Checklists have been used in the healthcare and aviation industries to mitigate mistakes and we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about how they can be applied in DevOps.

      <description>For many people, deploying applications is transparent or even irrelevant. If you are a developer, you might be focused on writing code and allowing magic to happen. By magic, I mean letting other people and departments figure out how to deploy your code. Similarly, you might be oblivious to deployments. You might be a tester, or you might have some other role not directly related to system administration, operations, or infrastructure.</description>

      <description>Too often as technologists, we want to align ourselves with the apolitical when it comes to the products that we diligently work on. Over the past few years, and more so over the past couple of months, it is more evident than ever that the choices that the companies we work for and efforts that we support directly impact our society for decades to come in significant ways. With great power, comes great responsibility, and with great responsibility comes the hard reality that we&amp;rsquo;re not just writing code and never were.</description>

      <description>Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD) concepts are increasingly adopted by many technology organizations and teams. CI\CD enables teams to establish processes that increase velocity, collaboration and quality of their codebase. CI/CD enables developer &amp;amp; operations teams to breakdown unnecessary silos and gain a deeper knowledge of their respective arenas.
In this workshop the participants will be introduced to the basic fundamentals of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment. Participants will learn the core principles of CI/CD and have the opportunity to reinforce what they’ve learned in a hands on workshop featuring the CircleCI platform.</description>

      <description>The adoption of CI/CD has automated the process of how DevOps teams build, test, and deliver software at rapid speeds and with high confidence. Although CI/CD platforms offer many benefits, in the attempt to make sophisticated pipelines, many teams run into the issue of “Pipeline Sprawl” - where configurations grow in complexity and volume forcing them to become unmanageable and difficult to scale. Pipeline sprawl also makes it difficult for DevOps teams to identify and reuse common execution patterns which diminishes their ability to efficiently ship new code.</description>

      <description>As we venture into new fields, we sometimes forget to apply the lessons learned in the past. As machine learning (ML) becomes more accessible to developers without a data science degree, and ML models multiply, we begin to see a glaring deficiency.
Many of the ML frameworks support easily building and tweaking ML models, but do not offer source control. To make matters worse, ML models often require prolonged trial and error, and even small changes in parameters can produce large changes in model accuracy.</description>

      <description>eBPF and XDP are kernel technologies which aim for network performance and can be considered as kind of a response for DPDK. Network story in Kubernetes and container world is still fresh, but Cilium and BPF try to make a really good start of it.
Cilium is on open source project which provides networking, security and load balancing for containers by using eBPF and XDP technologies in the Linux kernel. It provides eBPF and XDP features to CRI-O, Docker and Kubernetes.</description>

In this presentation, Kasper will be presenting Lunar Way&amp;rsquo;s perspective on a Cloud Native CI/CD solution using GitOps as the driver and motivation. GitOps was coined by Weaveworks, as a way to use developer tooling to drive operations, and use git as the source of truth. We will look at the reasons for going down this path and how it fits with a Cloud Native setup.</description>

      <description>In a cloud-native world, the &amp;ldquo;shift left&amp;rdquo; mindset for security teams is not just about technology, but also about culture. This talk will meld the two topics, bringing together core cloud-native security concepts such as the &amp;ldquo;Three Rs&amp;rdquo; of security with the cultural changes needed to achieve the outcomes the security teams are striving for as their partners in software development and operations implement XP/agile, SRE and other cloud native concepts.</description>

      <description>Cloud Native is more than a tool set. It is a full architecture, a philosophical approach for building applications that take full advantage of cloud computing. Going Cloud Native requires an organization to shift not only its tech stack but also its culture and processes. These human-centered changes can be the most difficult aspect of a transformation and many migrations stumble, or even fail, by making common mistakes rooted in cognitive bias.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes owning the mind share of the next generation, legacy applications are getting farther behind. There is hesitation around moving these legacy applications to this new platform. I’ll walk through a perfect litmus test of why any developed application can run on this unified platform.</description>

      <description>Code review é um processo importante do desenvolvimento ágil de software e está presente no coração do open source. Mas, muitas vezes, achamos que rever código é simplesmente observar e criticar, quando, na realidade, todo o processo de revisão é tão importante quanto o código em si.
Uma boa review pode ser o momento decisivo para que seu código seja entregue com qualidade e, por isso, é um processo extremamente importante que, muitas vezes, não é seguido pelos times e pelas culturas empresariais que temos atualmente.</description>

      <description>A few years ago, operating system configuration changes at Jack Henry &amp;amp; Associates were a very manual process. The Server Engineering team had a small, yet capable, team and had to manage OS layer and other configurations on 10,000+ systems. The entire team was burdened with an endless queue of cases from various stakeholders to implement configurations ranging from agent remediation to setting registry keys across a list of pre-defined systems.</description>

With fifteen years in IT and a successful career as a world-class infrastructure engineer, a speaker at many industry conferences, a blogger, analyst and technical marketing freelancer for Silicon Valley Startups and a CTO of a 1200+ infra and software engineering company, I can definitely say I suffer from impostor syndrome, and by extension, perfectionism.</description>

      <description>In the IT Industry, many incidents have been misunderstood or blown out of proportion due to poor handling of communications during and right after a crisis arises. The how, when, and how much communication can be the difference between a media frenzy and an outage that people work through and forget about. Ever since a database outage in January of 2017, companies and contributors have received timely and effective communication from Gitlab.</description>

Metodos ageis, fast deploy, CI/CD, V-Model… tudo e lindo ate que chega uma diretiva para atender requisitos de seguranca ou compliance. Aqui vamos colocar os ratos, gatos e cachorros juntos, mostrando como possam conviver e se ajudar mutuamente.
Muito se fala em agilidade e sinergia obtida atraves do DevOps mas ainda sem uma convivencia pacifica com processos relacionados a conformidade, risco e governanca (GRC).</description>

      <description>The presentation describes how IT infrastructure has evolved from spaghetti infrastructure, a setup where organic growth and individual parts of the system were inter weaved into the architecture where developers were operations, the prevalence of virtualization and the increase in IT usage created individual layers in the infrastructure and created silos of specialization and this created a difference between developers making software and operations managing the infrastructure. From this lasagna based system, that was cumbersome and difficult to manage the idea of developer techniques and methodology were added to create teams, describing infrastructure as code.</description>

      <description>L&amp;rsquo;infrastructure-as-code est l&amp;rsquo;un des piliers du devops : il est possible en quelques lignes de code de décrire et de gérer son infrastructure.
Mais, comment s&amp;rsquo;assurer ensuite que cette infrastructure est conforme aux standards de l&amp;rsquo;entreprise, que les risques (e.g. liés à la sécurité ou aux coûts) soient maitrisés, bref comment garder le contrôle opérationnel ?
C&amp;rsquo;est là que la compliance-as-code entre en jeu. Les règles et contrôles qui régissent une entreprise sont décrites en code.</description>

      <description>We have a choice in designing our software development careers. We can follow the path of a technologist learning and exploiting one technology to solve the problems that particular technology was built to solve. Alternatively, we can be a computational thinker who can address a much broader set of problems, choosing or designing the solution needed for the problem at hand. Computational thinking is more than thinking like a programmer, and we&amp;rsquo;ll see that not all programmers are thinking computationally.</description>

      <description>Learning to leverage CM tools for the design of ephemeral, experimental, analytical infrastructure projects was a key turning point in my career. It reinvigorated my love for R and data science, and introduced me to the world of DevOps. As more data scientists produce products or artifacts that go on to live in production, it is important to help them understand DevOps as well as how an analytic toolchain fits into the traditional technology value stream.</description>

      <description>Cloud Computing e containers ainda não são uma realidade em muitas empresas. Mas não é porque a sua infraestrutura ainda não está na nuvem e conteinerizada que você precisa continuar entregando, para o negócio, ambientes de TI de forma manual. Vamos mostrar como a Getnet saiu de um cenário de entrega de ambientes on premise que levavam até 45 dias para algumas horas. Nessa apresentação vamos detalhar qual era o nosso cenário, como endereçamos o problema, quais ferramentas foram utilizadas e quais foram os nossos resultados.</description>

Richard FojtaOrganizer I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in Software Development for more than 15 years. I prefer medium-size companies with medium-size projects and relative fast feedback loop. I&amp;rsquo;ve started organizing Prague DevOps meetup 3 years ago. It has helped me to meet and get to know a lot of companies, people and technologies that are DevOps-oriented. I&amp;rsquo;m currently learning how to be a good parent, which is costing me a lot of time, but I would like to keep in touch with communities and people with free mind.</description>

      <title>Container native load balancing in GKE</title>

      <description>Last year I have talked about problems of load balancing traffic to Kubernetes cluster with auto-scaling. Since then Google has introduced new &amp;ldquo;container-native&amp;rdquo; load balancing, that theoretically addresses those issues. Lets do a deep-dive and practical analysis to verify if this new solution is as groundbreaking as promised.</description>

      <description>In this workshop we&amp;rsquo;ll cover how to implement runtime security for containerized environments using the open source project Falco. We&amp;rsquo;ll cover the following:
  Learn how to create rules for an application. We&amp;rsquo;ll take a containerized application and create Falco rules to detect abnormal behavior in the application. We&amp;rsquo;ll profile an application&amp;rsquo;s system calls, then use the profile to create application specific rules.
  Learn how to alert on Kubernetes audit events like deployment creation, kubectl exec, privileged container creation, and other interactions with the Kubernetes API.</description>

      <description>Most applications nowadays are designed with containers in mind, or older projects are updated to be run within them. But what if you don’t have the time, resources or the authority to modify your applications?
Additionally, with service discovery, secure secrets management and dynamic secrets rotation now becoming commonplace, what is the easiest way to utilize these in an application without modifying how it handles configuration or polls for changes?</description>

      <title>Continuous Delivery to Continuous Operations: DevOps &#43;SRE = Continuous Culture</title>
      <link>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-jakarta/program/dheeraj-nayal/</link>

      <description>It is a well-accepted fact that organizational culture is the single most important critical success factor for driving DevOps transformation. However, with the emphasis on Continuous Delivery, is the DevOps definition of cultural transformation too limited to pre-production culture? Does the cultural value stream stop when the deployment button is pressed (or it presses itself)? While DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) do not share the same genesis, the dependencies for true end to end cultural transformation should be recognized and addressed.</description>

      <description>When Continuous Delivery was in its infancy, getting faster wasn&amp;rsquo;t one of the primary goals. It was about getting the right things into production safely, and providing the ability to change it quickly when required.
In other words, it was about making the business better.</description>

      <description>Hiring sucks, but on-boarding is NP-hard.
You&amp;rsquo;ve spent 100 hours or more to hire just the right engineers. From combing through 100s of resumes to carefully reading code samples of the few who made it to the final steps of your interview process. The offers are accepted and the start dates are set.
Now what?
It&amp;rsquo;s time to make the new hire feel welcome. It&amp;rsquo;s time to put them in a situation from day one where they have a goal to achieve.</description>

      <description>Dealing with any neuro-diversity is difficult and stigmatized, but lessons learned from DevOps and Complex Systems management have helped me improve how I handle situations. These lessons can be applied broadly and shift our thinking to how DevOps extends beyond tech alone.
Mental illness is stigmatized and hard to talk about publicly. Doubly so in the tech industry where we assign much of our personal value to our brains. I want to share my struggles with mental health and the lessons I’ve learned from Systems operation and DevOps that have helped me get by and frame my struggle in a manageable way.</description>

      <description>The DevOps principle of “Shifting Left” promotes testing early in the development cycle, for improved software quality and system health. At the same time, the rise of containerized microservice applications brings a new challenge: services are developed in isolation. It’s common practice that each service is frequently, thoroughly tested—i​ndividually.​ But they don’t get validated together until deploy time (ifatall!). In this session, we’ll explore techniques for running high-fidelity integration tests across multiple services, as part of a Continuous Integration workflow.</description>

We see that Chaotic engineering has an image problem, it has the reputation that you purposefully break production and that chaotic engineering is cowboy engineering but the true and best practices detangles your complex production systems and readies your systems, ensuring reliable, resilient environments.</description>

      <description>Infrastructure-as-code and cloud platforms enable the definition, configuration and automated provisioning of infrastructure using code. Practices like version control, four-eyes principle, test automation, staging environments, deployment pipelines and investing in observability bring with them the confidence and speed to deliver infrastructure changes into production continuously.
In this lightning talk, I would like to highlight some approaches that have proven themselves in practice, and how infrastructure changes can be brought into production continuously by using test automation and pipelines.</description>

      <description>Application delivery pipelines can make it a lot easier to quickly iterate on applications, but what about infrastructure? There’s toil hiding everywhere in infrastructure management, including processes like scaling up or down, patching, and more. On top of that, security requirements are often a huge consideration.
In this talk, we’ll explore some strategies for continuously delivering your infrastructure using an open source CI tool to build an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline. We will also use Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code tool to manage the infrastructure lifecycle.</description>

      <description>We talk a lot about creating a DevOps culture within an organization. While this conversation usually focuses around technology and delivery challenges, it also helps to look more broadly at how to create a culture of inclusion. When I think about a culture of inclusion, I imagine organizational customs, beliefs, and actions that truly honor and welcome all individuals. To me, such a culture encompasses a multitude of factors, including race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, mental health, religion, ethnic and cultural background, and socioeconomic status.</description>

      <description>Open-source software can create a great community of supporters and contributors, but management often has trouble seeing past the lack of revenue. There are ways to still get the positive culture of open-source software without having to commit the entire organization to transforming its business model.
If you would like to change the way you develop software, but you work within the confines of a closed-source, licensed product, you may feel like there is no way you could make that leap.</description>

      <description>APIs are traditionally associated with REST, or as they were with SOAP in previous generations, but APIs can be so much more than just that. In this talk I will describe how we built an API consisting of an asynchronous API using Kafka in combination with a traditional synchronous REST API, and why combining a REST and Asynchronous technologies is perfect to provide the best user experience possible.
Creating API solely using synchronous calls does not necessarily provide the best user experience.</description>

      <description>Remote teams are more disconnected and fragmented now more than ever. 54% of employees are unattached from their work &amp;amp; company. They put in the time, but not energy or passion, often doing the minimum required.
75% of managers struggle to maintain the culture remotely and it leads to 18% drop in productivity for the team. It impacts mental health, well-being, and churn of employees.
By creating belonging through social interaction at work, it not only improves the well-being of the employees but also increases productivity.</description>

      <description>Olá,
No QuintoAndar utilizamos o Vault para gerenciair o acesso de todos nossos engenheiros e aplicações a nossos bancos de dados! Através de regras fáceis de programar, conseguimos limitar quem e quais aplicações tem acesso a cada banco e com que permissões. Além disso, como o Vault gera credências dinâmicas e temporárias, limitamos enormemente nosso risco a vazamentos.
Percebi conversando com muitas pessoas da área que o Vault é uma ferramenta do qual muito se fala, mas que pouquíssimas pessoas utilizam.</description>

      <description>Nossos smartphones buscam constantemente por sinais de Wi-Fi e isso os transforma em &amp;ldquo;faróis&amp;rdquo; que sinalizam quem somos e onde estamos a todo o momento. Com isso, é possível coletar dados em larga escala e criar um mapa de como as pessoas se movem pelo espaço usando apenas Software Livre e alguns Raspberry Pis.
Nesta sessão, vou mostrar quais dados são vazados e como criar um mapa com eles. Todo o processo, incluindo o código usado, já está disponível publicamente no seguinte repostório: https://github.</description>

      <description>Taming the complex distributed systems we&amp;rsquo;re responsible for requires changing not just the tools and technical approaches we use; it also requires changing who is involved in production, how they collaborate, and how we measure success.
In this talk, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn about several practices core to production excellence: giving everyone a stake in production, collaborating to ensure observability, measuring with Service Level Objectives, and prioritizing improvements using risk analysis.

      <guid>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-edinburgh/program/nataliya-remez/</guid>
      <description>Why the most of DevOps transformations fail? What’s wrong with DevOps? We tend to focus on transformation itself a lot, instead of solving a real business problem. As stated in Conway’s law organisations tend to produce designs/software which are copies of the communication structures of these organisations. In other words, how we are organised is an important part of any transformation. Also in order to make progress with your transformation you need to know what you are comparing against and what are your measures of success.</description>

      <description>People are struggling with ways to reduce costs and still maintain developer throughput and velocity. Others might be in a place where they&amp;rsquo;re looking at moving to the cloud or retooling their current cloud footprint. The goal of this talk is to show the audience how they can structure their environments, even if they&amp;rsquo;re not currently looking at cost cutting measures. The approach will allow them to shift in a defensive spending posture, but limit the impact to development teams.</description>

      <description>Extreme Blue is IBM’s elite internship program. I was recently lucky enough to have my project proposal selected from hundreds of submissions to participate in the program. There was just one catch: my local Extreme Blue program had filled up and my project would be run out of the RTP lab, while I would be in Austin. The development cycle for the entire project is only 12 weeks long, consisting of on-boarding, five 2-week sprints, and a week for final presentations and transition.</description>

      <description>Extreme Blue is IBM’s elite internship program. I was recently lucky enough to have my project proposal selected from hundreds of submissions to participate in the program. There was just one catch: my local Extreme Blue program had filled up and my project would be run out of the RTP lab, while I would be in Austin. The development cycle for the entire project is only 12 weeks long, consisting of on-boarding, five 2-week sprints, and a week for final presentations and transition.</description>

      <description>Ignite Talk
I recently led a remote team of 4 interns through an extremely short development project. Through the use of Agile, Design Thinking, and XP, I was able to cut the cord and let the interns run the project themselves, taking on the roles of stakeholder and end user, rather than project lead.</description>

      <description>Today’s fast-moving software delivery environment emphasizes pushing value to production as quickly as possible. “Value to production” implicitly requires high quality—low quality is of little value to anyone! —which means teams need to focus on being able to specify, build, test, and deploy software effectively and quickly. Acceptance testing historically been manually intensive efforts run by a dedicated QA department, resulting in a slower pace of production releases.
No longer do we have to make acceptance a manual effort that requires a dedicated QA department.</description>

      <description>Eu sei que você já se perguntou: “nem bem digitei a senha e já recebi a notificação de compra do Nubank, como pode?”. E prometo não é nenhuma bruxaria, só uma infraestrutura de comunicação assíncrona construída para dar a sensação de tempo real. Ainda não acredita né?! Então vem conhecer melhor sobre Kafka, Finagle e outras tecnologias usadas para comunicação dos microservices no Nubank.</description>

      <description>O objetivo desta palestra é falar um pouco sobre o processo de reconhecer que está na zona de conforto, o que normalmente acontece quando percebemos que isso está acontecendo, e como se organizar e começar a sair de lá até um ponto em que se está aprendendo coisas novas constantemente, tudo isso sem dores (ansiedade, sentimento de fracasso e afins).
Durante a palestra, vou falar um pouco da minha experiência pessoal e fazer um paralelo com as three ways para mostrar como elas podem servir de inspiração e base para se organizar, pôr em prática o que for planejado, e manter esse ciclo de aprendizado contínuo.</description>

      <description>Devops is usually viewed from a traditional perspective of a collaboration of Dev, Ops, and QA, driven by the change in Culture, People, and Process. But how do you know where you stand and where to move? As in almost any field, data and metrics give you the gauges and instruments. In this talk, we’ll talk about the key measurements for the DevOps transformation process and provide you with three metrics you can start measuring tomorrow.</description>

      <title>Data Mesh Paradigm shift: Reshaping the data infrastructure</title>

      <description>Data Mesh is challenging a multi decade paradigm of infrastructure and architecture to manage analytical and big data. It is challenging the underlying assumptions that underpin the existing big data architecture and infrastructure: centralization of data and separation of analytical and operational infrastructure. In this talk Zhamak shares her observations on the failure modes of a centralized paradigm of a data lake, or its predecessor data warehouse. She introduces Data Mesh, the next generation data platforms, that shifts to a paradigm that draws from modern distributed architecture: considering domains as the first class concern, applying platform thinking to create self-serve data infrastructure, and treating data as a product.</description>

      <description>Does your application use a database, and have you ever changed the schema? Then you know these database migrations can lead to downtime.
This talk discusses non-destructive changes, rollbacks, large data sets, tools and strategies to migrate data safely, with minimum disruption to production.</description>

      <title>Databases on Kubernetes: Why you should care</title>

      <description>Developers always expected databases to work out-of-the-box, but historically it is the exact opposite.
With the rise of Kubernetes StatefullSets and CRDs, we started thinking about running databases on it. But why should I do that in the first place? How hard is it? Which are the challenges? Is it production already? All those questions will be answered during a live demo where we will deploy a database, deploy an operator, fail nodes, scale up and down with nearly no manual intervention.</description>

En los 2 últimos años he formado parte de un equipo enfocado fundamentalmente en hacer Data Engineering en TrustYou. Quiero compartir mis experiencias en cómo este equipo disfuncional en aquel entonces que además, entre otras, no usaba CI builds, tenía como proceso de despliegue `manual+ssh+git pull`, tenía grandes silos de (des)conocimientos y entornos no reproducibles; ha llegado a ser lo que es hoy. Contaré qué probamos, qué funcionó, qué no funcionó, qué visión futura tenemos en términos de procesos y prácticas y qué papel ha jugado y jugará la cultura y prácticas DevOps en ello teniendo en cuenta además que estamos en un contexto de BigData, Data Science, Data Engineering y código legado.</description>

      <description>En los últimos años no paramos de oír a las empresas que quieren “ser” ágiles y que quieren “hacer” DevOps para mejorar su Time To Market, automatizar tareas, migrar a cloud, reducir recursos… sí, suena raro pero es el discurso real que existe en España. Con esta charla queremos dar nuestra visión, basada en experiencias diarias, de cómo se está aplicando actualmente Agile y DevOps en las empresas.
Se introducen gran variedad de herramientas y tecnologías en los procesos de la organización, sin tener en cuenta que la finalidad de las mismas es fortalecer y facilitar el día a día de los equipos de trabajo.</description>

      <description>En un mundo VICA (Volátil, Incierto, Complejo, Ambiguo), donde los muros cayeron, dormimos sobre microservicios, la cultura global es un mashup plural, cualquier producto o servicio puede ser pedido, producido y entregado en cualquier espacio del planeta, no hay chances de reinventar la construcción de software y la entrega continua de servicios si no es deconstruyendo y reconstruyendo la cultura que fue la base de los viejos hábitos.

      <description>Configuration is moving to the edge.
System components are becoming more decoupled, with substantial portions of the infrastructure config being embedded inside their source repositories.
This more distributed and decentralized definition of the system improves iteration speed and maintenance concerns (application developer wins) but also increases the difficulty of managing the cross-cutting concerns of the organization like security, compliance, and reliability (DevOps losses).
In this talk, we will discuss why cloud configuration management needs to adjust to handle these competing tensions.</description>

      <description>DevOps is not just having your Dev and Ops teams sit in the same room reporting to the same manager, introducing some agile tools, automating some manual steps of established processes and carrying on working the same way. You haven&amp;rsquo;t actually changed the way the teams operate. Building a culture is at the core of DevOps adoption, and this involves a change in mindset. This session will look at what key cultural characteristics made Red Hat the world&amp;rsquo;s leading provider of enterprise Open Source solutions (spoiler alert: they are based on Open Source principals) and how you can apply these to your teams to break down silos and enhance openness, sharing and collaboration.</description>

Attendees will see a series of hands on attack techniques for exploiting serverless functions, and learn how to apply security controls defending against the attack.
The session starts with insecure secrets management in Serverless. Live demonstrations will show how a vulnerability in a function can allow attackers to exfiltrate secrets from a configuration file inside the function’s execution environment.</description>

      <description>Sou Deise Santos de Oliveira, Curitibana, 38 anos, esposa do Thiago, mãe do Valentim de 2 anos e 9 meses, colorada, apaixonada pelo mundo da agilidade, em entregar sempre a próxima fatia de valor. Extremamente entusiasta de comunicação falada e escrita. Representante de várias causas sociais, com objetivo de levar a agilidade nos contextos menos favorecidos (Ex: Presidios, Senac Comunidade, Casa do Pão). Encontrei nessas ações uma forma de devolver a sociedade as oportunidades que tive na vida, de honrar minha mãe que morreu sendo analfabeta funcional e de contrariar a sociedade, a TI, visto que ser negra, PO não é tão comum no nosso ramo, mas eu to aqui para fazer a diferençar e somar nesse universo de diversidade!</description>

      <title>Delivery Flexibility: Pipeline as Code with Jenkins &amp; Groovy</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CI/CD helps us streamline processes for other teams BUT&amp;hellip; we sometimes forget about ourselves! A standardized, repeatable process driven through code accelerates the work all technical teams do. Pipeline as Code brings those same benefits to the CI/CD process. This eliminates the need for manual job creation. More importantly, pipeline as code also allows the pipeline to be different for any code branch, which allows for tremendous levels of flexibility.</description>

      <description>Fazer o deploy de uma aplicação no Kubernetes é algo bem simples, mas como empresas com muitas aplicações podem criar um minimo de padrão de deploy em diferentes times? Como garantir que o que esta sendo executado em ambientes de teste e homologação também será executado no ambiente produtivo? O Helm, junto com outras ferramentas poderosas que se utilizados seguindo as melhores práticas podem ser ótimos aliados nesse desafio.</description>

      <description>Sou responsável pela WeboneSystem soluções em TI, e recentemente resolvi adotar o uso do kubernetes para execução da aplicação WBSRad. Porém o caminho não foi simples, e as dores de cabeça durante o processo de migração serviu como lição aprendida. Saindo de uma aplicação que já executava em container, só que com a relação de 1 container para 1 servidor virtual, foi possível passar por diversas situações adversas. Quero apresentar tal caminho, os custos envolvidos, as dificuldades, o processo e mudança de alguns paradigmas.</description>

      <description>In the period 2017 through 2019, after nearly thirty years of consolidation around a layered internal IT security model, a major Australian bank shifted its business scope to include the consumption of public cloud technologies to support a significant core of its business operations.
This is a major departure from a historical alignment, where the banks IT systems were physically domiciled within their premises and protected from public or unmanaged ingress by a perimeter DMZ and a host of physical and process controls.</description>

Las empresas avanzan rápidamente hacia la adopción de plataformas Cloud con la visión de satisfacer a un cliente cada vez más exigente. El dominio de estas plataformas exige la incorporación de conocimientos sobre nuevas tecnologías y un cambio cultural en la entidad asociado a los flujos de trabajo. Kubernetes es la plataforma por excelencia donde las empresas despliegan sus productos, pero sin la correcta automatización de un flujo de trabajo, ésta plataforma puede convertirse en una verdadera pesadilla para el equipo que la gestiona.</description>

      <description>KEYNOTE TALK ABSTRACT Taming the complex distributed systems we&amp;rsquo;re responsible for requires changing not just the tools and technical approaches we use; it also requires changing who is involved in production, how they collaborate, and how we measure success.
In this talk, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn about several practices core to production excellence: giving everyone a stake in production, collaborating to ensure observability, measuring with Service Level Objectives, and prioritizing improvements using risk analysis.</description>

      <description>Production ownership, putting teams who develop components or services on call for those services, is a best practice for ensuring high-quality software and tightening development feedback loops. Done well, ownership can provide engineers with the power and autonomy that feed our natural desire for agency and high-impact work and can deliver a better experience for users.
But in practice, teams often wind up on call without proper training and safeguards for their well-being.</description>

      <title>Developing Devopsers: Strategies for effective mentoring</title>
      <link>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-boston/program/jonathan-maltz/</link>

      <description>Mentoring and onboarding new engineers is one of the most important things you can do to grow your team. Effective and intentional mentoring decreases the number of bugs shipped to production, improves the quality of your application, and helps keep code standards high as your team grows and changes.
Yet for all of its importance, we hardly talk about how to mentor effectively. There are many resources about how we can provide productivity gains by learning about new language features or tools , but there are hardly any about how they can get 400% productivity gains for their team by helping other devopsers be be more productive.</description>

      <description>The practice of engineering the processes of a development effort are often ad hoc. While that can clearly work well for trivial things, it tends to be under-clubbed for larger efforts. Likewise, intense process with constant updates and schedules is equally impossible to deal with. This talk deals with something of the happy medium but leaning far more towards enterprise efforts and the results that are usually expected of that. We’ll talk about and demonstrate elements of a consistent build lifecycle and why you need one, and discuss what happens when you don’t.</description>

      <description>Developing meaningful SLIs is not an easy task, but your Error Budgets and your SLOs are only useful if they’re informed by good SLIs. In this talk we’ll be performing a deep dive on how to develop SLIs that actually reflect the journeys of your users. We’ll start by describing an example web service that should look familiar to you, identify the “low-hanging fruit” metrics you might be tempted to use, talk about the limitations of these low-hanging fruit, and conclude with some concrete examples of what useful SLIs for such a system might actually look like.</description>

      <description>TALK ABSTRACT DevOps requires a drastic shift from a traditional long-running project mindset. Best intentions can easily be thwarted simply because the new ways seem to go against the old way of thinking that teams and their managers hold so dearly.
The Chicken or the Egg? With so many changes in culture, mindset, and process involved in DevOps transformation, it can be difficult to see how outcomes will change without some hands-on context.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately we can&amp;rsquo;t all work in startup companies. Some of use have to deal with legacy code bases. These are often structured as a monolith and tightly coupled. They typically are hard to build and deploy. You might think all the new DevOps practices and toys are not suitable for your context. You are wrong!
We will discuss strategies to work with legacy code and still use DevOps practices and tools.</description>

      <description>DevOps is not just for unicorns and startups, i.e., Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, etc., in fact, it provides more business value for traditional organizations through modernization of IT processes, software, systems, and practices, which can create efficiencies that lead to much larger potential gains. Tech debt, legacy systems, old software, and outdated data centers are all more common than not, in most organizations. DevOps can provide more value in these organizations through eliminating waste and creating efficiencies.</description>

      <description>Technology organizations have a lot of people that experience deployment or work pain and it comes at the cost of the physical and mental health. What can we do as a community and as leaders to help make sure that DevOps is inclusive of making sure that we talk more about a life work balance as opposed to a work life balance. How do we enable a community with a culture of personal well-being and health so that everyone can provide their best effort?</description>

      <description>Databases are central to just about every application system but remain a neglected topic when it comes to DevOps. Seriously - while application change delivery has evolved to where changes can be applied in amazingly short intervals, most enterprise databases still live in a silo that exists somewhere on the other side of a bureaucratic ticket-driven process from 2003. To be fair, databases are critical things which, when broken, will break everything else.</description>

      <description>In the 5+ years in our DevOps journey we started with a DevOps department, followed by DevOps teams, applied SAFe, renamed to System team. There is a reason why DevOps transition are hard, especially in big enterprises where IT is considered as a cost center, service oriented, siloed and ticketing driven. In this lightning talk I would like to highlight some of my personal take around Agile, lean, DevOps.</description>

      <description>DevOps is not a job role: in most organizations and at scale, development and operations are two separate skill sets, though admittedly the lines between the two are blurring more every day. “DevOps” comes down to having more Development in your Ops with, as a few examples, infrastructure as code, scalable automation around CI/CD (continuous integration and delivery) and database automation; and more Ops in your Development with containerization, test driven development, and “microservices” or API driven development.</description>

      <description>Ignite talk
Uber has been doing DevOps since it hired its first developer back in 2009, and has grown to a scale where it now has 1000&amp;rsquo;s of developers, making 1000&amp;rsquo;s of changes to 1000&amp;rsquo;s of micro-services in production, every day.
In this talk, Kenneth will give a virtual lightning tour of Ubers DevOps stack showing how it&amp;rsquo;s wired together, how so many changes are made in a safe way and that you might not have to build it all from scratch if you also want to scale to thousands.</description>

      <description>Developing for developers. Help developers help themselves. How to manage the overhead of scaling a solution that is core to driving the DevOps culture. DevOps is a cultural shift towards empowering teams to own their products end to end. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at how we can keep teams focused on the technology by eliminating the need to add more people and process to the mix.</description>

      <description>What can you learn about devops and software delivery practices by looking at data from a platform with more than 300,000 developers, 25,000 organizations and 25+ million builds per month? As I recently joined CircleCI, I was interested in this new data set from a large SaaS developer platform and the kinds of questions that it could answer: What trends and patterns pop out from the data? Are they different than what is seen through surveys where responders opt-in to participating as compared to being aggregated through platform usage?</description>

      <description>DevOps vem se mostrando uma metodologia adotada por muitos times dentro e fora do país. Muita tecnologia, novas ferramentas para cuidar, novos processos, ajustes e uma penca de alteração na forma de desenvolver, entregar e operar software. Muito se fala em se preocupar mais com cultura, mas o que realmente devemos nos preocupar na adoção? Quais os problemas enfrentados nas grandes organizações que deixa o desafio ainda maior. Será que as empresas estão preparadas para a adoção?</description>

      <description>After switching many different roles over the past years , I&amp;rsquo;ve been running my own business over the past 5 years.
Given my background, &amp;ldquo;doing&amp;rdquo; devops I assumed would be the least of my worries. I wanted to learn how devops could make a difference on business level.
This talk is an experience report on my learnings:
 Devops is not so special in a company context Decisions made in other departements impact devops and vice-versa How to improve relationships/feedback beyond dev &amp;amp; ops Optimize for the whole system , not just the part between dev and ops  p.</description>

      <description>Optimizing the flow, amplifying the feedback loops and establishing a continual learning and experimentation environment while having several distributed teams working together is not an easy job. On one hand, establishing effective collaboration model between such teams requires special handling. Especially when considering the different barriers including the different locations, different languages and cultures. On the other hand, security regulations are usually more complicated when working on several locations. Security regulations are not an option.</description>

      <description>O MLOps (Machine Learning e Operations), de forma similar ao DevOps, é a combinação de práticas e ferramentas que permitem aos times de Data Science e Operações melhorar a implementação de modelos, através da governança de modelos de ML (Machine Learning) e IA, monitoramento, validação, colaboração e comunicação.
O propósito da apresentação é demonstrar casos de implementação de ML utilizando o Azure DevOps, GitHub e Azure Machine Learning em clientes. E como trabalhar a cultura dos times (cientistas de dados e operações), práticas de CI/CD e modelos de machine learning (criar, treinar e implantar) para alavancar a implementação de experimentos na empresa.</description>

      <description>If you are in a small startups, or if you are an entrepreneur starting one, you are probably involved in many areas of business. From product development, to project management, to software design and development and finally to operations. So, you are already DevOpsing, right? Not necessarily. Just doing Dev &amp;amp; Ops together doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily result in DevOps.
A lot of startups struggle with implementing DevOps practices, mainly because most of them have been created from the point of view of a big company.</description>

      <description>Most conversations around DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) focus on medium to large business. Where there are sufficient funds and enough sprawling infrastructure that a team dedicated to upkeep is required; the SRE/Ops team. But, what about startups? Enabling rapid development, high reliability, and consistent infrastructure is just as vital to survival as it in in larger companies, if not more. Yes, there are startups who have already found market fit and need to rapidly scale - but what about the startups like us that are still looking for the right fit?</description>

      <description>DevOps is more than the process of automating your CI/CD pipelines to generate code and deployment artifacts for production. It&amp;rsquo;s also about organizational change and integration of many subtle processes that help you deliver applications seamlessly from development to production through your operations.
Let&amp;rsquo;s unlock the power of process integration with a hands-on workshop using your own devices (laptops). We&amp;rsquo;ll take you through the integration of an organizational process as part of your DevOps strategy.</description>

      <description>DevOps is becoming increasingly common practice in many an IT organization. But how does that work in the world of mobile app development?
Mobile development is built around large and infrequent releases with serious up-front testing.
Releasing and update of your iOS app means waiting for Apple to manually review your new release. This could take up to a week and seriously hampers any ambitions of continuous delivery.
This talk shares our team&amp;rsquo;s take on DevOps in the mobile world.</description>

      <description>Devops in regulated industries
Many industries regulate and audit the software development process to ensure safety or security risks are managed in a professional and repeatable manner. This makes sense if you are handling financial transactions, air traffic control, insulin pumps and car braking systems.
Proving compliance with regulation is an under-served area of devops. Most regulations are written with general guidance, not specifying the exact recipe to follow. In order to comply, organizations implement manual processes and gate-checks, with every software release documenting the proof that the agreed processes have been followed.</description>

      <description>Over the past 500 years, there have been 16 cases of a rising power threatening to displace a ruling power. 75% of those cases resulted in war. Although your organizational transformation probably won’t lead to war, it could be contentious. History can help prevent conflict when driving change. This talk will analyze human tendencies, historical data, and provide real-world examples of how to avoid conflict during your DevOps journey.</description>

      <description>Numerous talks have described how NASA, the US military, and countless other entities respond to incidents. These are good examples but, there are specific instances they’re used and they might be harmful to your organization if done poorly. There is one thing all these organization do have that yours can adopt to be more effective though: Communication. In this talk, we’ll dive into experiences in incident response during my time in the USAF and how to implement better communication in your organization.</description>

      <description>DevOps Mobile funciona da mesma forma que o tradicional DevOps? Infelizmente não… Nesta palestra será discutida as diferenças e dificuldades encontradas na aplicação de DevOps para mobile, e algumas dicas de como devemos trabalhar para também aplicar com sucesso a cultura DevOps nesse cenário.
Hoje a maioria das empresas de desenvolvimento web estão construindo e aplicando a cultura DevOps por meio de toolchains completamente automatizadas, de forma a realizar entregas ágeis com apenas um push do código no repositório.</description>

      <description>DevOps surge como um movimento, uma comunidade de profissionais que compartilham práticas e técnicas para estabilizar e dinamizar a TI, integrando e orquestrando boas práticas de mercado, disciplinas, frameworks e corpos de conhecimento diversos, alguns deles até conflitantes. Como ficam os papeis dos profissionais que ocupam responsabilidades nesse processo, os times e suas estruturas. Vamos analisar em detalhes suas composições e necessidades, devido a grande confusão, divergências e polemicas que isso trás no mercado.</description>

      <description>This talk will bring us back to basics and explain the core build building blocks of DevOps. With so many tools in the market it sometimes becomes over whelming for any one who is headed for a digital transformation. I will explain what is the essence of DevOps and that it is much more than just some tools and platforms. Its beyond tools and techs. This talk will also help beginners to understand that just learning some tools does not make the DevOps engineers , its about adopting the DevOps mindset.</description>

      <description>This talk should trigger a lively discussion, because as we know from the practice not everyone in Ukraine understand what is DevOps and what is the main goal of its implementation. Plenty of people just have not enough experience to do things in a right way. Or they have no idea how to study on their own or others&#39; mistakes. From my side, I&amp;rsquo;ll share own experience about DevOps, answer to the questions what is it in real life and what do we mean talking about DevOps with our partners and customers from Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States.</description>

      <description>I’ll introduce “the apocalypse matrix,” which has a severity axis (mild to severe) and a locality axis (personal to global). Preparing for a major global apocalypse (zombies) happens to also prepare you for a mild local apocalypse (iced into your house with no power for several days). Pivoting this concept to an IT apocalypse will help us come up with plans for incident responses and pack our metaphorical bug out bags.</description>

Are you thinking about modernizing your database development process&amp;hellip; someday&amp;hellip; maybe? Do you have directories full of .sql files you use to build your application? You know unit tests should be included as part of your build process and you are going to start adding them&amp;hellip; maybe next week?
If you think modernizing your dev process will be difficult, time-consuming &amp;amp; expensive, you may be surprised at how easy and inexpensive it is to get started.</description>

      <description>Agile is about speed, but also about quality.The idea of this talk is explain the journey to automate smoke tests quality at acceptable levels, and how this required a mindset change towards our definition of done and information sharing among teams
Agile and DevOps is not just about speed - it’s also about results for the business, and that implies delivery quality built into the process. A company only establishes itself in the market when they offer good levels of quality, scalability, capacity and availability.</description>

      <description>For the past 15 years, Google has been following a set of practices for keeping systems operational called Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). Recently, Google began speaking publicly about SRE, publishing a book, releasing new features as part of their cloud offering, and much more.
At the same time, communities raised concerns about the conflation of DevOps and SRE. Is SRE &amp;ldquo;DevOps 2.0&amp;rdquo;? Is SRE trying to overtake DevOps? Is DevOps dead?</description>

      <description>Há um consenso de que DevOps é uma cultura e não ferramentas A, B e/ou C. Se é uma cultura, por que dizemos e não explicamos quais sãos as formas de aplicá-la nas organizações? Esta apresentação é uma tentativa de entender as relações das diversas ferramentas, metodologias e funções sobre DevOps aplicado nas organizações e tentar definir nos dias atuais como é a Cultura DevOps e as dificuldades de aplicá-las em toda a organização.</description>

Devopsdays has grown from one event in 2009 to 80 or so in 2019, and the scaling lessons of this conference series can apply to the wider world of distributed systems.</description>

This session helps you minimize the learning curve with container orchestration, specifically Kubernetes, by bringing DevOps best practices into the mix. This is not another Hello World session with quick tips. Instead, you can expect a deep dive into how you can truly go from zero to DevOps superhero by simply selecting container tooling specifically built for simplifying the process.</description>

      <description>Virou buzzword, virou moda e marketing. Muitas empresas e times estão usando DevOps como rótulo para atrair profissionais, mas a maioria não faz idéia do que é, para que serve e como fazer. Que tal reservar um tempinho para ouvir falar de DevOps no mundo real, quais problemas ajuda a resolver, dicas de como implementar, ouvir histórias de lugares que trabalhei que deu errado e outros que deram certo. São 8 anos de histórias tristes e também finais felizes com DevOps, ajudando a construir sistemas e equipes.</description>

      <description>We’re very sorry to announce that DevOpsDays Baltimore 2020 has been canceled. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and growing concern over the spread of the disease, we have decided not to hold DevOpsDays Baltimore 2020. Many factors went into this decision, and all of it together led to the feeling that this is the right decision for our community. Ultimately, the health and well-being of all involved is our top priority.</description>

      <description>Berlin Skyline by Fred3rik in Wikipedia licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0     -- DevOpsDays Berlin 2020 Cancellation It saddens us that we have to do this, but we as the DevOpsDays Berlin Organizers don&#39;t see a way around this. We sat together at the beginning of July - still unsure if we wanted to run an &#34;in person&#34; conference. Looking at the rules that are in place for Berlin, we could have done this with a very reduced set of attendees, at the date we intended the conference to run.</description>

      <description>DevOpsDays Houston COVID-19 Update: CANCELLED, TICKET REFUNDS COMING Last updated: June 13, 2020, 8:00am CDT
 Given the continued uncertainty of the COVID-19 situation and the evolving corporate policies prohibiting or restricting travel or participation in large events, the organizers of DevOpsDays Houston have decided to cancel the 2020 event, previously rescheduled to August 18-19, 2020.  While it is disappointing that we can&#39;t gather together right now, we look forward to resuming our normal DevOpsDays event in 2021.</description>

      <description>Important information regarding novel coronavirus (COVID-19)  We have taken the difficult decision to cancel DevOpsDays London for 2020. Our top priority is the safety of our attendees, our sponsors, and our team, and we feel that holding the event as planned with 400 attendees in person would not be a responsible action to take. We&#39;ve also decided against holding the event virtually, as we feel like it wouldn&#39;t do it justice.</description>

      <guid>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2020-portland-me/welcome/</guid>
      <description>Devopsdays Portland, ME 2020 has been canceled.
Due to the COVID-19 outbreak and the continued efforts within our community to combat its spread, we have decided to cancel our inaugural 2020 event. As we were hoping that the later date would allow us to carry on with planning, there is too much uncertainty. Our community is rightly focused on more pressing matters now and for the foreseeable future.
The difficult decision to cancel this year&#39;s event has been made a bit lighter knowing that it&#39;s really a postponement.</description>

      <description>We have decided to cancel DevOpsDays Portland 2020.
Many of you have come to know DevOpsDays Portland as a place to learn and build connections with others in the Portland DevOps community. Creating this environment has been an honor and comes with responsibilities that we don’t take lightly.
Although DevOpsDays Portland was scheduled for September, and we hope that this situation will have greatly improved by then, there is still a lot of uncertainty.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re very sorry to announce that DevOpsDays Seattle 2020 will not be happening in April as planned. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and growing concern over the spread of the disease, we have decided not to hold DevOpsDays Seattle on April 14th and 15th. While we are disappointed not to host the event in April, the health and well-being of the community is our top priority.
Thank you for your patience as we researched whether we could hold DevOpsDays Seattle later this year.</description>

      <description>On March 12th the WHO officially declared the COVID-19 virus a pandemic - and while we were planning to follow this advice the BC health minister has now also officially enacted a ban on events larger than 250 people. We are forced to make the difficult decision to postpone the event until March 2021. We are looking into providing refunds to all stakeholders, but are unsure to what extent refunds will be possible and hope to have more information within the week.</description>

      <title>DevSecOps - Automating Security in DevOps</title>
      <link>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-boston/program/anand-tiwari/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-boston/program/anand-tiwari/</guid>
      <description>As part of this workshop attendees will receive a state-of-the-art DevSecOps tool-chest comprising of various open-source tools and scripts to help the DevOps engineers in automating security within the CI/CD pipeline. While the workshop uses Java/J2EE framework, the workshop is language agnostic and similar tools can be used against other application development frameworks.
Security is often added towards the end, in a typical DevOps cycle through a manual/automated review. However, in DevSecOps, security can be injected at every stage of a DevOps pipeline in an automated fashion.</description>

      <description>E aí pessoal, tudo bem? Vou apresentar conceitos como: scaneamento de imagens de Docker, SAST (no desenvolvimento), DAST (na prática), ferramentas para cada parte do deploy, Sonarqube, OWASP (o reporte e o scanneador SP), trabalhando com validação na pipeline, algumas dicas pra quem trabalha com K8s diretamente da Kubecon, administração de vaults e de acessos SSH e o mais importante: a engenharia social! Dicas de cultura: quando é que a galera começa a se tocar que segurança também é um problema de todos?</description>

      <description>A metodologia DevOps não envolve apenas as equipes de desenvolvimento e de operações. Se você quiser aproveitar ao máximo a agilidade e a capacidade de resposta proporcionadas pela abordagem DevOps, também será necessário que a equipe de segurança da TI desempenhe um papel integrado em todo o ciclo de vida das aplicações da sua empresa.
Por quê? Antigamente, a segurança era delegada a uma equipe específica que atuava isoladamente no estágio final do desenvolvimento.</description>

      <title>DevSecOps is a Misnomer</title>
      <link>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2020-new-york-city/program/victoria-geronimo/</link>

      <guid>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2020-new-york-city/program/victoria-geronimo/</guid>
      <description>DevSecOps is a misnomer. The idea that Security is smashed in between Dev and Ops is exactly the problem we face. Many believe security is the blocker before getting their application out to production. Owned by some distant, unapproachable team, security can seem like the new deep divide with a ‘throw it over the wall’ mentality.
Instead, Security must be sprinkled throughout the DevOps cycle, taught from the beginning when developing best practices, and owned by the entire team.</description>

      <description>Modern enterprises are implementing the technical and cultural changes required to embrace DevOps methodology. DevSecOps extends DevOps by introducing security early into the SDLC process, thereby minimizing the security vulnerabilities and enhancing the software security posture. In this workshop, we will show how this can be achieved through a series of live demonstrations and practical examples. As part of this workshop attendees will receive a state-of-the-art DevSecOps tool-chest comprising of various open-source tools and scripts to help the DevOps engineers in automating security within the CI/CD pipeline.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Known vulnerabilities are a fact of life with open source software. According to the Snyk State of Open Source Security Report 2019, last year vulnerabilities for npm (Node) grew by 47% while Maven Central (Java) and PHP Packagist disclosures grew by 27% and 56% respectively. They also tracked over 4 times more vulnerabilities found in RHEL, Debian and Ubuntu as compared to 2017. According to the Sonatype 2019 DevSecOps Community Survey, 24% of organizations surveyed revealed a breach within one of their web applications in the prior 12 months.</description>

      <description>Modern development teams deliver features at a rapid pace using new technologies such as containers, microservices, and serverless functions. Operations and infrastructure teams support these rapid delivery cycles using Infrastructure as Code, Test Driven Infrastructure (TDI), and cloud automation. However, security teams are using traditional security approaches that don’t keep up with the rate of accelerated change. Security must be reinvented in a DevOps world by taking advantage of the opportunities provided by continuous integration and delivery pipelines.</description>

I will not talk about it in my talk. ))) But I can tell with what technical and process problems we met building DevSecOps and how we solved it from security point of view. Indeed – real cases and truly working tips.
How to make usage of different tools (static and dynamic analyzers and Open-Source control) convenient for developers and security?</description>

      <description>I work at Kuehne + Nagel for the Online Solutions department (KN FreightNet e-commerce Platform) in Hamburg since 2011. Originally from Venezuela, I joined as a software developer, but I’ve had the chance to try myself out in different roles during my time at the company so far. I’ve gone from pure software development, to a “mixed” role as developer/analyst where I took care of a lot of requirements engineering and coordination tasks, further to a “pure” analyst role with a sneak peek into agile coaching and back to the technical roots of my career now as an engineer in a platform/infrastructure team, working hard with my teammates to migrate our runtime architecture from VM-based to Container-based in a private cloud.</description>

      <description>Netflix has long championed “chaos engineering” to ensure viewers’ “Stranger Things” binge watching sessions are not interrupted. Netflix is one of a growing number of companies including Nike, Amazon and Microsoft that leverage chaos engineering as a means of stress testing their cloud infrastructures against a variety of unpredictable cloud events, such as a loss of cloud resources or entire regions. This has enabled them to create highly resilient infrastructure environments and ensure reliable application delivery.</description>

How do we give devs control over their environments, giving them access to multiple clusters and cluster resources? How do we enable rapid, local iteration and free developers from waiting in a CI/CD queue? Can we go from source to executable to Docker image to Kubernetes cluster in a one line command?</description>

      <description>We’ve all taken different paths to get to be here at this conference, but in the end we are all here at “the same place.” This talk will cover some personal journeys of those in our industry to help us all better understand what it took for those people to get here today. The goal of this talk is to help us understand that not everyone’s journey was like ours and provide the opportunity for us to exercise empathy for each other.</description>

      <description>Como movimiento cultural, las prácticas DevOps, enfatizan en la comunicación entre los profesionales de Desarrollo y Operaciones que automatizan los procesos de mejora continua, entrega de software y evolución de infraestructura. Dichas prácticas evolucionan desde principios y valores provenientes de diversas corrientes del agilismo, las que tuvieron lugar inicialmente en la industria del desarrollo de software.
Las organizaciones que promueven la adopción de prácticas DevOps, se embarcan en definitiva, en un camino de transformación.</description>

      <description>As creators of products and services, we’re pretty good at thinking we’ve got it all sussed. We map user journeys, we create roadmaps, we write user stories. We know what we want people to do; what actions we want them to take. But do we really know who these people are? Do we really know what they need? Do we take the time to find out, or are we building products and services based on our own assumptions and biases?</description>

      <description>Our industry has fundamentally changed over the last decade. Monolithic architectures have evolved into microservices. Applications are distributed on infrastructure across the globe. And an increasing number of companies are moving to a remote-first culture with engineers distributed as widely as applications. Our technical environment and tooling ecosystem has changed radically from the original conditions in which DevOps was created. So what’s next? Learn about the next phase of DevOps: a distributed model that emphasizes swift development, observable systems, accountable engineers, and resilient applications.</description>

      <description>What do people think when they heard the term DevOps? Most people say DevOps is a new methodology for developing a software using a set of tools, run by a self managed tech savy team and try to automate every thing. In this circumstance do we still need a leader since everybody seems to be able to managed them self, having sophisticated skill and most of the task run by automated tools?</description>

      <description>To overcome organizational inertia or fierce opposition and move new ideas, innovate processes in organizations, requires champions. Yet we do not know much about what makes some champions effective while others fail to deliver the goods. What I discovered by studying Security Champions for improving Security Processes in Agile Teams is that effective champions differ from ineffective ones but that also the way that leaders work with the champions also impact in their effectiveness.</description>

      <description>This talk addresses the pressing problem of data quality, and proposes DataOps as the solution.
Businesses today don’t have a black and white divide between staff who write programs and staff who don’t. In large enterprises, most of the staff write some software. There is a continuum between the people who dabble in excel formulas through to the core application developers. Most of the middle analyze data. Few of those people have been exposed to the transformational ideas of DevOps, or even Agile.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes workloads are split to entities and are easy manageable, right? So why you should use another abstraction layer on top of abstraction layer? And why one YAML can be better than another YAML? In this talk I will explain benefits from using Helm to manage Kubernetes workloads.
Many people think that Helm is just a fancy add-on to Kubernetes. But using it has a real impact on simplification of Kubernetes workload management.</description>

      <description>In 2019 we still struggle with our local build and testing environments. Every developer will be familiar with problems like:
 trying to set up a new project, only to discover that the requirements listed in the readme are out of date, incomplete or no longer available trying to set up a new project, only to discover that there are no requirements listed in the readme “works on my machine” issues like inconsistencies introduced by slightly different configurations across your machine, your colleagues’ machines and CI flaky integration and journey test runs against external dependencies like databases caused by environmental issues each project having its own esoteric shell script or makefile used to drive development tasks  There is a better way!</description>

Demonstrarei um caso real de dockerização de aplicação web, implementação de automatização de deploy em entrega contínua num pipeline, com lint, teste unitário, build da imagem, tag da image, testes end-to-end, push em repositório e deploy automático em QA e produção.</description>

      <title>Docs Or It Didn&#39;t Happen: Integrating documentation into DevOps culture</title>

      <description>Trustworthy, comprehensive documentation is as core to the discipline of DevOps as testing. In an ever-more complex ecosystem, documentation is critical for development velocity, code quality, continuous delivery, and the reliability of services in production - yet developers consistently report its lack as the most significant productivity problem they face.
The challenge is that while every developer needs documentation to do their job, most developers dislike and avoid creating it - and as long as doc work is perceived as low-status drudgery that takes time away from coding and goes unrecognized and unrewarded, neglecting it is entirely rational behavior.</description>

      <description>Learn how scientists document their work and are able to pick up new experimental protocols quickly. Apply the concepts of scientific protocols to your documentation to make them more useful to yourself and your users.
Working in the &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; part of STEM has taught me a lot of applicable practices to apply to tech. From thinking about distributed systems as cell signaling pathways to troubleshooting deployment problems on variable at a time to writing and expecting high fidelity documentation.</description>

Documentation can be a huge asset in freeing you and your team up to work on awesome software or tasks so you don’t have to answer the same message 5 times. This talk includes tips and tricks on how to jumpstart integrating documentation into your normal day to day.</description>

      <description>One of the biggest hurdles that documentation writers face in maintaining documentation is staying on top of everything as it changes. We need to know what’s going on in the organization to be aware of pending changes to the code, so we’re not blindsided by code changes that may break documentation links, and cause docs to be incorrect or outdated. Sometimes it can feel like we’re just trying to catch up with what everyone else has done, which can be exhausting and frustrating.</description>

Rolling out wide sweeping changes doesn’t have to be a nail biting affair. In our lightning talk, we will focus on how to allow environment wide changes to roll out to a large enterprise, in a safe, controlled manner, without the need for heavy bureaucracy.</description>

      <description>One of the benefits of Serverless architectures, and AWS Lambda specifically, is that there is #NoOps required to get your code live. You provide the code and deployment, patching and hardware are abstracted away from you.
The issue is, there is still a server and security still requires work.</description>

      <description>The most basic point in security is to make sure the thing you are securing is actually what you think it is. While that seems obvious, cultural blind spots often lead us to overlook the basics while obsessing over more exciting, exotic scenarios.
It is a common bit of human nature and even shows up in pop culture as a plot device in spy or &amp;lsquo;heist&amp;rsquo; movies. The thieves swap the real thing for a fake while the chump guards think everything is OK.</description>

But let’s face reality, there was a huge failure: Apollo 13’s Service module was seriously damaged and if things stayed the same people were going to die. In his book “Failure: Why Science is So Successful” Stuart Firestein dispels the idealized myth of science and makes the case that Failure is a key element in the advancement of Science.</description>

      <description>As security, reliability and continuous integration become more of a concern for organizations of all sizes, DevOps teams have to come up with ways to support these increasing workload demands. We all have many tedious, often toilsome, chores related to maintaining on our production environment(s). So, we automate the toil; now what do we do? We collaborate with other teams to help reduce their toil! That is, we scale the practice!</description>

      <description>Writing a book is the hardest achievement I’ve set out to accomplish. I finished it like a marathoner at the end of a long race, crawling toward the finish line. I was empty.
But finishing the book isn’t the interesting story. The journey is where I learned the valuable lessons. Only in the tears and the toil, in the mud of my own emotions and self-doubt, did I learn the truths of struggle, resiliency and creative work.</description>

      <description>Les enjeux de Kubernetes dépassent largement le cadre feutré du déploiement des applications stateless 12 factors. A travers sa versatilité, Kubernetes s’affirme de manière croissante comme la plateforme universelle de déploiement.
Kubernetes peut donc être utilisé pour déployer vos composants applicatifs, mais également les technologies d’infrastructure qui les soutiennent, y compris quand ces technologies ont été conçues avant l’émergence de Kubernetes.
L’exercice d’intégration d’une technologie legacy dans Kubernetes est intéressant pour 2 raisons :</description>

      <description>The ultimate objective of a DevOps approach is to deliver quality products to your customers as efficiently as possible. DevOps shops that achieved this state point to continuous testing as a key contributor to their success. However, QA and testing have become forgotten orphans in the DevOps journey of many organizations. For groups that have incorporated testing, many have a release cadence that resembles something more like waterfall. The culprit is often the inability to incorporate stable automation into their testing practices.</description>

      <description>Flaws in code don&amp;rsquo;t just happen when we work too fast. In fact, they are often the result of unchecked ego. Overgrown egos can stifle both your codebase and the team developing it. This talk will share surprising lessons from philosophy and how incorporating this wisdom can help tame our egos. Then, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the tools that support an ego-less programming practice.</description>

      <title>Egoprogramophobia, or fear of one&#39;s own code: how testing can change your life</title>

      <description>You fear your code. Once in production, you are afraid of changing it. A bug? You fix it using messy, yet surgical, hacks, rather than a refactoring that leaves your code better.
Admit it! You fear your code. But there&amp;rsquo;s a way out: just write tests. Writing tests is impossible! It makes my productivity tank! My boss doesn’t leave me any time for writing tests!
These are all excuses for not writing tests.</description>

      <title>El camino Infrastructure as Code para aplicaciones basadas en contenedores</title>

      <description>Este es el camino que estamos transitando en Moove-it para incorporar patrones de Infrastructure as Code en los diferentes proyectos y las motivaciones detrás de la formación de un equipo SRE encargado de esa tarea.
Es muy común que un desarrollador trabaje en varias aplicaciones diferentes al mismo tiempo. Tener esas aplicaciones en contenedores, con sus dependencias explícitas, con un método de deploy estandarizado y uniforme facilita mucho el proceso de onboarding de nuevos desarrolladores, así como bajar el tiempo que lleva agregar nuevas dependencias (como por ejemplo redis) a la aplicación, facilitar la escalabilidad de los mismos y mejorar el monitoreo.</description>

      <title>Elastic JVM: Automatic Vertical Scaling of the Java Heap</title>
      <link>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-geneva/program/ruslan-synytsky/</link>

      <description>Containers provide much better elasticity and density than VMs, but JVM-based applications are not fully container-ready. The first issue is that HotSpot JVM doesn’t release unused committed heap memory automatically. Second, it is not possible to increase the size of the JVM heap at runtime. To solve these two major issues and make JVM more container-friendly, a new patch is implemented for the Garbage-First collector in OpenJDK. This session shares details of what is done and how the added improvements enhance resource consumption efficiency.</description>

      <description>When a SaaS company determines there is a compelling business need for an On-Premises delivery option, the reality is that any technical solution for supporting both Saas and On-Prem will be both difficult and expensive. There are, however, ways to limit the expense and pain. I will share one solution that leverages Docker images and On-Prem Docker orchestration technology to manage complexity of the application codebase and architecture for both SaaS and On-Prem.</description>

      <description>DevOps is about creating a culture of shared responsibility in delivery teams. It is recommended to embed operations skills into delivery teams to reduce friction and enable them to deliver products to customers faster but whenever there is a need for significant investment in tooling and automation and teams lack the skills to self-manage a full application and operations stack, having a separate Platform engineering team can help. Organizations that consider establishing such a platform engineering team should be very cautious not to accidentally create a separate DevOps team.</description>

      <description>Every developer needs to know how to write secure code. As the world becomes more digital, security is becoming increasingly important. HackerOne is a company with a community of over 700,000 hackers, who report security vulnerabilities on their platform. Having that many hackers so close to potentially critical (and valuable!) information means that keeping the HackerOne platform secure is of the utmost importance. Over the years, HackerOne has implemented different methods of promoting secure coding practices and ensuring platform security at different stages of the devops lifecycle.</description>

      <description>Be agile! Hold retrospectives at least once per month! Have a weekly 1:1 meeting! Shoot for 99% unit test coverage! Automate everything! Centralize your monitoring and logs! Containers everywhere!
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to read a tech blog or go to a tech conference without being inundated with advice about software engineering best practices. This guidance is usually great &amp;ndash; in some circumstances. But, like everything else in software engineering, there are tradeoffs.</description>

      <description>A decade after the first DevOpsDays the term &amp;ldquo;DevOps&amp;rdquo; has permeated the enterprise, with jobs, departments and mega scale initiatives, but is this all aligned with the original spirit or is it bastardization by vendors and consultants? What&amp;rsquo;s the world of Enterprise DevOps really like and for all the talk, what difference has DevOps made to the massive world of enterprise IT?
Drawing on close to a decade working with enterprises adopting automation and attempting their own DevOps journeys, Nigel will show what the dark matter of DevOps in the enterprise is really like, all those huge deployments struggling to move on from the massive weight of manually managed legacy environments.</description>

      <description>Description: Fully automated environments enable you to create and destroy environments as needed, which provides the flexibility of integration testing before code is merged into the main line. This ability allows engineers to take more risks on changes with less consequence of disturbing the teams around them. Less disruption empowers higher productivity.
Abstract: Production is not the only environment whereact on a company or organization. At any point in the software development life cycle, an engineer who is blocked or making unplanned fixes is a financial drain.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes se ha convertido en el estándar de facto para correr aplicaciones en el cloud. Además tiene un potencial tremendo como plataforma de desarrollo, ya que permite crear en segundos entornos de desarrollo efímeros, compartiendo de manera óptima los recursos hardware y desarrollando las aplicaciones en un entorno similar al de producción. Sin embargo el ciclo de desarrollo basado en la creación de imágenes y redespliegue de aplicaciones hace su uso impracticable para el ciclo de desarrollo pre-commit.</description>

      <description>Montar um ambiente automatizado com CI/CD é um grande desafio, seja pelo ponto de conhecimento técnico ou até mesmo pelo fato da escolha da melhor ferramenta.
Nessa palestra, é apresentado um pouco do processo de aprendizado de migração do Jenkins para o GitLab CI, tal como o uso em um cenário específico, mostrando principalmente as principais dificuldades, e que resultados positivos estão sendo alcançados.
Agenda prevista  Apresentação do cenário atual Motivação para migração da ferramenta anterior para o GitLab CI Apresentação dos recursos usados no GitLab CI Apresentação do novo pipeline configurado no GitLab CI  </description>

      <description>Nem sempre quando rodamos um pipeline de configuração de ambiente estamos livres de problemas. O grande problemas é que uma vez que começamos a automatizar estes fluxos perdemos contato com o feedback direto do terminal e isso pode trazer alguns problemas. Para isso existem os testes. Para validar que o pipeline efetivamente rodou com sucesso no ambiente alvo. Nessa palestra quero demonstrar o uso do testinfra e do molecule em duas situações distintas e como seu uso pode facilmente validar o sucesso ou não de um pipeline.</description>

Una de las definiciones de DevOps que más nos gustan es la de Jez Humble: “Una comunidad de práctica interdisciplinaria dedicada al estudio de la construcción, la evolución y el funcionamiento a escala de sistemas resilientes que cambian rápidamente.” Pero, ¿qué significa funcionamiento a escala? Teniendo en cuenta que nos dedicamos a construir, operar y evolucionar sistemas complejos, el entendimiento de las leyes básicas que afectan a la escalabilidad nos proporciona herramientas muy útiles para entender y mejorar nuestros sistemas, procesos o cultura.</description>

      <description>Imagine you have set up a Kubernetes cluster on premise. It works fine for a few months. And then, with no reason, master nodes got high load and you are not able to fix it. There is nothing obvious in the logs, or at least they are inconclusive. After a few hours it fixes on its own. The situation repeats after a few weeks. This is a story of a difficult investigation, with no witnesses, circumstantial evidence and lots of suspects.</description>

      <description>Ethics in computing sounds like a fairly straight forward proposition at first glance. But when you begin to peel back the complicated layers at which technology and its implementation converge, its anything but simple. In this talk we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss some of the ethical and morale frameworks that we can apply to the computing industry. As we do that we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss and ask ourselves the questions
 Exactly what is ethical or morale when it comes to technology?</description>

      <description>Do you consider yourself technical? What about peers in other roles? How does your perception of someone’s technical experience influence your behavior? We often refer to certain roles as “technical”, but everyone has a variety of experience and deep specialty. Despite our best intentions to treat everyone equal we may unconsciously discriminate against others based on our assumptions of their technical experience. This can result in unfairly modifying our interactions with certain roles, when quite likely coworkers in all roles could benefit from breadth and detail in our conversation.</description>

      <description>A more indepth, tactical version of a talk I&amp;rsquo;d given once before, not recorded though:
Effective incident response is more than just “get alerted, fix a problem.” Having a systematic approach that discourages “tunnel vision,” helps responders develop their own intuition, style, and procedures are critical in not only solving problems but also in preventing responder burnout.
Knowing what to monitor, how, and what questions to ask of your internal customers and of your monitoring platform itself can be difficult.</description>

      <description>Believe it or not, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot military training can teach us about DevOps.
In IT we spend too much time on local optimizations which are ultimately hurting our overall &amp;ldquo;mission&amp;rdquo;. We waste cycles on minor issues instead of identifying our greatest risks and focusing there. And much more.
The military is the ultimate in command and control, making sure your every second is accounted for and every step planned. This is pretty much the opposite of a DevOps culture where sharing and accepting failure are norms… right?</description>

      <description>Our systems don’t have to be perfect to be operational - planes, networks, and elite athletes all function at extremely high levels even though they are not operating at 100%.
As an industry, we have moved the locus of control from hardware to operating system to virtual machine, to container, to orchestration, and now we are approaching serverless. None of that has reduced the amount of work that must happen, it just makes it possible to re-use and conceptually compress the work of others.</description>

      <title>Evolution of QA to GA: The Sensu Go Crucible</title>

      <description>Quality Assurance is a crucial component in releasing software. But who is responsible for QA processes, tools, and methodologies when you&amp;rsquo;re a young startup with limited bandwidth? The answer is: everyone. At Sensu, we experienced the painful process of discovering this in preparation for our General Availability release when engineers naturally were heads down in development, creating mounting technical debt with regard to testing.
The evolution of QA at Sensu is a story of identifying process challenges, researching multiple solutions, and implementing efficiencies in order to provide confidence in the product we&amp;rsquo;ve built.</description>

In a year long collaboration between Gene Kim and Dr. Stephen Magill, we objectively examined and empirically documented software release patterns and cybersecurity hygiene practices across 36,000 commercial development teams and open source projects.</description>

      <description>Modifying the schema of a production database is hard. If something goes wrong, the impact on both customers and the team can be enormous. And it can be hard or even impossible to rollback a database schema change if things go wrong. And the same is true for any architectural change for a production application.
The Branch by Abstraction and Strangler Pattern makes significant application changes easier. Are there any similar patterns we can use to make production database changes less risky?</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;DevOps programs were traditionally assigned to the more technical bastions of an organization, where they were incubated and nurtured by a devoted family of tech leads and operations experts. This initial positioning succeeded in removing troublesome bottlenecks, improving quality, and advancing software delivery practices. A win for sure, but won and done? Hardly.
The natural extension of early DevOps is found in our more recent industry focus on continuous integration continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.</description>

      <description>Our app ecosystems expanding complexity means we require more advanced tools to observe them properly. The right tooling will help you to track down the causes of problems, or even prevent them proactively. Different components pose different observability needs. Then you need to correlate different data types to make sense of things. I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss a framework for considering the info you need. Then I&amp;rsquo;ll show ways of abstracting info to make it more easily digestible.</description>

      <description>Fear is rampant on too many teams. People are afraid to make changes, afraid to voice their opinions and afraid of making mistakes, especially when it comes to production environments. The trouble is, fear kills performance. If you have a culture of fear, none of your fancy processes or practices will help you. Making people awesome isn’t possible if people are not safe. Safety is both a basic human need and a key to unlocking high performance.</description>

      <description>From The Phoenix Project there are three ways. This short talk is about the all important third way, which focuses on continual improvement and taking risks.
The Third Way is about creating a culture that fosters two things: continual experimentation, taking risks and learning from failure; and understanding that repetition and practice is the prerequisite to mastery. In operations we often focus on &amp;ldquo;keeping the lights on&amp;rdquo;.
We all have Technical Debt.</description>

We all have Technical Debt. Technical Debt has to be paid down. But which projects should we focus on? We have to start by identifying our constraints. By focusing on our constraints we can prioritize not only the work that we release, but also the technical debt projects that should be worked.</description>

      <description>You don’t need Kubernetes to automatically push green builds to production&amp;ndash;Developer Advocate Shelby Spees walks through how Honeycomb uses CircleCI, Terraform, Chef, a handful of home-grown scripts, and Honeycomb itself to speed up deployments and make them safer. You’ll also hear about what went wrong along the way, and how Honeycomb&amp;rsquo;s Service Level Objectives allow the team to evaluate and mitigate risks.</description>

      <description>If your Continuous Integration pipeline is slow, you are basically wasting money! A CI pipeline is an essential tool for any modern development team, as the necessary quality assurance mechanism that ensures they can deliver working software. Slow, (or, worse, broken) pipelines cause serious impediment to development teams, and this impediment directly translates into wasted money.</description>

      <description>Databases are intrinsically hard. They contain/represent so much business value that the risks of downtime or other major incidents are, in some cases, catastrophic. With so much associated risk, many organizations find themselves stuck in legacy management practices for them: non-representative staging environments, manually applied upgrades, complicated multi-step schema change rollouts&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s not pretty out there!
What if, instead, our databases were as well-managed as the rest of our production infrastructure?</description>

      <title>Feedback Week - An Experiment in Empathetic, Effective Feedback Gathering</title>

      <description>In retrospect, Feedback Week was so simple, that I was shocked to learn that no one had tried it before.
Feedback Week’s mechanism is straightforward: for one week, everyone on the team was randomly assigned another team member, and they would gather one-to-one feedback from everyone else, on behalf of their recipient. At the end of the week, everyone synthesized their feedback and delivered it to their recipient. This is a common practice for engineering managers to perform on behalf of their reports, but why had it never been done within teams?</description>

      <description>When humans are faced with a traumatic experience, our brains kick in with survival mechanisms. These mechanisms are the familiar fight or flight response, but can also include the freeze response - which occurs when we are terrified or feel that there is no chance of escape.
In this talk I will explain the background of fight, flight, and freeze, and how it applies to organizations. Based on my own experiences with post-traumatic stress (PTS), I will give examples and suggestions on how to identify your own organizational trauma and how to help heal it.</description>

      <description>When humans are faced with a traumatic experience, our brains kick in with survival mechanisms. These mechanisms are the familiar fight or flight response, but can also include the freeze response - which occurs when we are terrified or feel that there is no chance of escape.
In this talk I will explain the background of fight, flight, and freeze, and how it applies to organizations. Based on my own experiences with post-traumatic stress (PTS), I will give examples and suggestions on how to identify your own organizational trauma and how to help heal it.</description>

      <description>When humans are faced with a traumatic experience, our brains kick in with survival mechanisms. These mechanisms are the familiar fight or flight response, but can also include the freeze response - which occurs when we are terrified or feel that there is no chance of escape.
Sufferers of post-traumatic stress continue to feel these fight, flight, and freeze responses long after the trauma has passed, because our brains are unable to differentiate between the memory of trauma and an actually occurring event.</description>

      <description>Unhealthy working cultures can creep into all kinds of organisations, from start-ups to large enterprises. Tech teams are sometimes composed from a limited demographic, with newly-skilled practitioners ready to change the world: they&amp;rsquo;re often male, young and ambitious.
They&amp;rsquo;ve created some of the greatest technology of the last 40 years, but at what cost to those who participate? Combined with internal politics, insufficient resources and inexperience, these teams can produce some unintended biproducts from stress to sexual harassment and burn-out.</description>

      <description>If someone asks you, can you describe how your company actually makes money, and how you contribute to that? Lots of us have jobs that we understand very technically, but no one has bothered to highlight the business value for us. We need to learn to describe our value ourselves to make sure we continue to contribute what matters and have relevance.</description>

      <description>Is site reliability engineering and serverless a match made in heaven or is something missing and it’s a disaster waiting to happen? In this talk we will discuss just what is required for building reliable Serverless systems and introduce a new concept called FinDevOps and learn about using cost as an operational metric. We will also explore each of the SRE principals such as embracing risk, service level objectives, monitoring and others and map them to their serverless counterparts to identify challenges and best practices.</description>

      <description>This talk will focus on how you can use principles &amp;amp; metrics from Site Reliability teams and Developer Experience teams to create a culture of technical excellence, high velocity, and psychological safety.
When thinking about metrics that guide technical &amp;amp; team strategy, there are two underlying priorities that ideally should align towards one goal: system and engineering team health. Metrics relating to system health provide insight on how stable the user experience is, whereas engineering team health metrics provide insight on the experience of the engineers building these systems.</description>

We do some digging, deploy a fix and draft a post-mortem. We might even identify some things we could have done differently, or suggest a process to avoid such problems in the future. Everyone sits down for the ceremonial presentation of the post-mortem and nods sagely, going back to their work secure that valuable lessons had been learned&amp;hellip; right up until the next time the system crashes and we go through the motions again.</description>

      <description>There is no such thing as a perfectly scripted and executed transformation. No matter what the consultants have promised you, it is a bumpy and unpredictable road. Instead of sharing the success stories and what went well, this is a story about failure. Which mistakes have been made in transforming organizations towards a new and sexy way of working? What went wrong, and why? And what can we learn from such epic fails?</description>

      <description>Adopting a DevOps culture is a bit like flipping a house. Having flipped houses since the mid 90&amp;rsquo;s I can give detailed interesting parallels between the two. These range from the bizarre and possibly paranormal, to the dark and disgusting. Attitude is everything in both worlds.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ll dig into the measurements, risks, and opportunities, then look at real tactics and strategies to paint a dramatically different picture. I&amp;rsquo;ll act as our Dungeon Master to facilitate the session, throw monkey wrenches and share my perspective, but this will be mostly a collaborative exercise that will leave you with the skills to run your own VSM sessions.</description>

      <description>Our industry has been exploding! This has been amazing for growth and financial advancement of the industry, but comes with a huge negative cost to the workforce.
IME the technical workforce has been the most negatively impacted by this great expansion. When business demands (constantly) exceed capacity, strong leadership must be present to prioritize initiatives to mitigate downstream impacts. Unfortunately, important services for the workforce tend to be the first to go, widening the gap for developing future leaders and technical SME.</description>

      <description>Humans tend to prioritize the urgent more than the important. Test Driven Development (TDD) is an important process that is known throughout the agile community and embraced as a testing best-practice. The test-first development methodology codifies your design and acceptance criteria and helps teams to maintain project scope and improve both productivity and quality. However, for all the discussion and talk, most developers and organizations do not fully adopt the practice, because they are busy prioritizing the urgent such as deadlines and cutting costs.</description>

      <description>Building Slackbots is really useful and extremely fun, but the development environments for Slackbots tend to be clunky or require setting up servers for really small applications. In this talk we&amp;rsquo;ll go through setting up a Slackbot development workflow using the Serverless framework, with continuous deployments and hot reloading so that you can focus on the bot&amp;rsquo;s functionality rather than all of the setup involved.</description>

      <description>Traditional “Ops” tasks such as provisioning VMs in on-premises data centers, configuring load balancers and firewalls, performing manual deployments, or configuring application-level monitoring and alarming are subject to significant automation efforts by many companies. On top of that, modern public clouds such as AWS, Azure, or OCI provide a plethora of tools and features that aim at increasing IT productivity even further. More precisely, (cloud-based) automation reduces the human resources needed to run and maintain software.</description>

      <description>Day 2 Kubernetes is where things start to get tricky and observability is extremely important to anyone building things outside of localhost. Teams spend many sprints researching and comparing different monitoring and logging tools. The goal here is demystification to help those folks reach a decision quicker that they feel more confident in. By showcasing an entire insight stack deployed into a fresh cluster we can help jumpstart their journey.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s possible to have rapid feature delivery and happy developers without sacrificing high security and compliance. At LifeOmic, we&amp;rsquo;ve built an automated change management system that allows production deployments without slow human approval. We maintain HIPAA and HITRUST compliance while still allowing continuous delivery.
This talks shows how to collect data from BitBucket, Jenkins, and security scan tools to ensure that the approved processes have been followed. You&amp;rsquo;ll hear how fast production approval incentivizes developers to follow good practices, and become advocates for following the process instead of pushing against it.</description>

      <description>This talk describes our journey through the Clouds! At Nuage Networks we build SDN products and services that can be deployed anywhere. Our traditional CI/CD system has been testing on local Openstack Cloud. In our effort to scale dynamically based on demand, we explored the two Cloud service providers, Google Cloud Platform(GCP) and Amazon Web Services(AWS). This talk describes our struggles, accomplishments, and lessons learned using both platforms. It will compare and contrast the two platforms in the process and explain why one works out better for us than the other.</description>

      <description>How long will that take?
It’s a question we’ve all either asked or been asked. How long will it take to get that feature out the door? How much time would you need to build this kind of software? How many people would we need to get this project done in three months? A major component of DevOps is minimizing time to market, but for larger releases, how do you know ahead of time how long development might take?</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered why DevOps, Continuous Deployment, canary releases, microservices, chaos engineering and reducing Technical Debt work so well? Why it works at all? These and many other concepts all have one thing in common. They are affected by a hidden force: antifragility.
Antifragility is truly one of the most fundamental forces at play. The word ‘antifragile’ did not exist until 2012 when Nassim Nicholas Taleb published his book titled ‘Antifragile, things that gain from disorder’.</description>

      <description>What if the code you’ve written alienated some of its users? Or what if it caused a group of people real-life harm? If you&amp;rsquo;re a responsible engineer, these should be among your biggest concerns.
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning has introduced a new paradigm wherein code can do actual harm outside of its contained environment. While some of the effects may be comical (think: bad art made by AI), others can be deeply unfair to large groups of your users.</description>

      <description>Many of us use git every day but we don&amp;rsquo;t really understand how it works. This leads to lots of headaches and messy code bases. Lets dive into git to understand how it all comes together - the objects that make up git, creating the commits that we all know and love, and working with them. What are branches, actually? What happens when we merge and when we rebase? Which one should we choose?</description>

      <description>Automated CI/CD is an important part of any DevOps transformation. There are advantages for productivity, security and inclusion to having the CI/CD system tightly integrated with version control, issue management and code review. GitLab, as a single application for the entire DevOps lifecycle, includes CI/CD pipelines in all versions both FOSS and commercial. This workshop will walk attendees through the basic architecture of the GitLab CI/CD system and provide a guided tour of creating a simple CI/CD pipeline, understanding the syntax of the declarative pipeline definition .</description>

      <description>GitOps is an emerging pattern for cloud native applications. This operating model simplifies Kubernetes ops while simultaneously improving the developer experience. GitOps enables continuous delivery of configuration updates and application deployments to Kubernetes.
Through the lens of GitHub, Argo CD, and Azure Kubernetes Service, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore use cases and benefits, principles and practices, architecture and tooling, and what GitOps changes in our day-to-day.</description>

      <description>The journey to Kubernetes tends be long and tedious as it involves many changes including the CI/CD tool chain. Far from the HelloWorld demo, we will present a real feedback with a solution relying on the GitOps approach without forgetting the legacy world of traditional infrastructures ! The declarative approach — brought by the DevOps movement and enforced by Kubernetes/GitOps — brings a lot of power using Git as the Source of Truth and integrate easily in the enterprise with dozens of applications and IT environments.</description>

      <description>GitOps is a paradigm or a set of practices that empowers developers to perform tasks which typically (only) fall under the purview of operations. It’s a way to do Kubernetes cluster management and application delivery by using Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. Being Git at the center of delivery pipelines, engineers use familiar tools to make pull requests to accelerate and simplify both application deployments and operations tasks to Kubernetes.</description>

      <description>Today, our systems are made up of a patchwork of tools and services from different companies. We no longer need to be experts outside of our core business model. Companies now make it relatively accessible and affordable to use everything as a service, rather than creating everything from scratch. The days of running your own SMTP server are gone; there&amp;rsquo;s an API for that. But how did we get here, and where do we go from here?</description>

      <description>The creation of the base cluster infrastructure, sitting outside of the deployment pipelines, was automated through Terraform. The Kubernetes deployment themselves were generated using Rudder, a simple internal templating engine (instead of Helm), and deployed using the same base processes and CD pipelines used in the on-premises infrastructure. Another aspect that needed some attention was connectivity between datacenters as the component both uses and is used by other components, so a VPN was necessary.</description>

      <description>It is very rarely sufficient to just “automate” existing processes in large organisations because often they are no longer fit for purpose. So whys it so hard to change a process? Why are empathy, influence and risk management so important? Let’s go back to basics and remember what we care about.</description>

      <description>Gathering up changes and rolling them out all at once late on a Thursday or Sunday night, when fewer customers would be online and the team could be on &amp;ldquo;high alert&amp;rdquo; for incidents and then strive to resolve them before &amp;ldquo;business hours&amp;rdquo; on Friday or Monday, may have made sense at one point, but in a world striving for shorter cycle times, small batch sizes and limiting work in progress, the release night and the big-bang release cutover have become an anti-pattern that stifles innovation &amp;amp; leads to wider outages, not smaller ones.</description>

      <description>In this talk we’ll introduce Grafana Loki: a new take on log aggregation. We, as developers and operators of “cloud-native” applications wanted a simpler, ad-hoc investigation focused log aggregation tool. While full text indexing can be useful in some use cases, when troubleshooting issues across services we felt simpler indexing and grep-esque searching would be of more use.
Designed specifically with Kubernetes pod logs in mind, Grafana Loki is itself a Cloud Native application: microservice based, horizontally scalable, and multi-tenant.</description>

      <description>This session is an evolution of our talks around growing Dojos (though awareness of dojos is not necessary for this talk).
In this session we will look at the challenges facing organizations and people today trying to learn new skills (committment, context, multitude of needs).
From there we will look at how we learn exploring explicit vs tacit knowledge.
We will wrap up with tangible ways you can start growing an organization that continuous learns - looking at addressing the whole value stream to provide context and growing an organization that has internal coaches and teachers (along with models for that).</description>

      <description>Site-reliability engineer roles did not exist 10 years ago. With the growing cloud adoption, we find roles in the market that didn’t exist 5 years ago: “Cloud-Native engineers”, “Cloud-Architects”, etc. Where do suitable candidates appear from?
My answer: people evolve into those new roles. For the companies it’s faster to find people with the right (but not necessarily perfect) combination of the required skills in this way than trying to find someone filling in all new job requirements.</description>

      <description>Our product started in 2012 with a handful of developers, running a few short product builds per day, each executing about 10,000 test cases. Today, we have over ten times as many developers working on the product, with a build and test infrastructure running over 250 builds and 20 million test cases per day. At the same time, we have moved to a continuous delivery model that reduced our release cycle from once per year to once per month.</description>

      <description>Over an eight-month period, our organization formed a dedicated internal DevOps team. This team initially focused on fighting the fires currently in production and dedicated to improving the reliability of services in the company. The team’s focus was shifted from not just keeping things up, but eventually improving the experience for our own developers.
In this talk, attendees will learn about the cultural changes that took place going from reactive operations to being dedicated to improving overall reliability across the technology organization.</description>

      <description>Agile teams and ways of working are proliferating in today&amp;rsquo;s work world. The Agile Manifesto touts “people over process and tools,” and the principles mention, “build projects around motivated individuals, and trust them…” as well as “the best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.” But how can we hire the right people and best utilize the people we have? Heidi will discuss the criteria for hiring a great agile team and for growing a more high performing team; drawing from experience from her extensive background in teamwork and collaboration, and pulling from sources such as the Google Aristotle study, Patrick Lencioni’s Five Dysfunctions of a Team, Stanley McChrystal’s Team of Teams, and others.</description>

      <description>I am a software engineer who loves computer science. From its most simple basis to its more obscure problem.
I think Free Software and Open Source are the way, as a computer scientist, I can make some difference to the world around me. Sharing knowledge and mentoring younger developers is one my favorite tasks. It is a way of giving back to the community what one day was given to me.</description>

      <description>As a manager of a team that has On-Call responsibilities, I am personally accountable for ensuring engineers are prepared to receive pages. As a systems thinker, I&amp;rsquo;ve broken this down into many different layered approaches that leave room for adaptation in the face of new and emergent system behavior.
Ok, great&amp;hellip; what does that mean? Troubleshooting problems within a complex system requires enormous amounts of context-specific expertise. It is next to impossible to provide adequate training to build that expertise.</description>

In between coding for 20+ years professionally, he presented various courses and workshops over the years, including the Java Master courses of JavaSpecialists.eu; mostly so he can learn interesting stuff. More recently he discovered microservices, reactive programming and serverless, and he’s been having a lot of fun with it.</description>

      <description>At Sky Betting and Gaming we&amp;rsquo;ve been on a DevOps journey since 2011. We&amp;rsquo;ve undertaken numerous &amp;ldquo;DevOps Transformations&amp;rdquo; and learned that this is an ongoing program rather than a &amp;ldquo;Big Bang&amp;rdquo; initiative. As the company has restructured in to agile autonomous tribes and squads, we&amp;rsquo;ve identified and reused a number of patterns and techniques as we&amp;rsquo;ve evolved our ways of working. This talk aims to share those learnings.</description>

      <description>Le système d’organisation appelé Holacracy est un modèle d’auto-gouvernance qui s&amp;rsquo;est développé depuis le début des années 2000. Notre société s&amp;rsquo;est lancée sur ce modèle tout en y intégrant notre culture DevOps pour finalement s’apercevoir que les deux s’alignent parfaitement bien. Dans ce talk, nous présenterons pourquoi et comment nous sommes passés à l&amp;rsquo;auto-gouvernance et en quoi Holacracy et DevOps se rejoignent.</description>

      <description>Real world life lessons on successfully implementing SLIs and SLOs. We started somewhere 3 years ago with help from Google CRE and iterated to a more mature understanding of SLI’s as an accurate proxy for user pain, and adequate SLOs as a faithful threshold for tolerable user disruption. Will give an executive summary on the real world practical steps we took to bootstrap the SRE practices. Important lessons learned, tips and tricks of what we have picked up in the last 3 years</description>

      <description>Our talk will be about our transition from a start-up where there was little or no SRE practises to when acquired by Genesys and what SRE best practices they brought to the table. We want to talk about the lessons we learned as a group through Chaos Engineering and how we were able to integrate our services and become part of resilient cloud platform. We also want to talk about our thinking on the matter and how we went about achieving this.</description>

      <description>All the technical freedom and diversity we enjoy in our industry is the result of internal, grass root evangelism. Over the last couple of decades, thought leaders have strongly opposed manufacturer-centric strategies and argued the case of Open Source and Open Standards. This ultimately led to the success of Linux and Open Source we have today.
But now, two decades later, the IT industry is in upheaval again: All three major cloud providers have been pushing their serverless solutions in order to lure customers into a new form of vendor lock-in.</description>

      <description>DevOps culture is today a reality for many engineering teams. Yet, security practices are still unknown to many. Where to start? How can security be included in our day to day instead of “added” later? A Threat Modelling process is a proven and effective way that can help you transition to DevSecOps.</description>

      <description>I know my database will be slower on Kubernetes and cloud native storage, but HOW MUCH slower? This is a question everyone thinking of moving traditionally hosted stateful services like databases to Kubernetes ask all the time. This presentation will detail a series of microbenchmarks on PostgreSQL, CockroachDB and others, running on and off Kubernetes in a variety of configurations, including bare metal, local storage, Ceph and Rook. You&amp;rsquo;ll get a solid idea of what the cost in latency and throughput is for abstracting away your storage problems, and be able to make platform decisions for yourself.</description>

      <description>Starting in DevSecOps, the motto that got me through was, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Okay To Be New.&amp;rdquo; Though I’ll tell you a secret, which is that I didn&amp;rsquo;t always believe it. I was new at Dev, Sec, and even Ops! I felt the motto should have been, &amp;ldquo;The impostor is strong in this one.&amp;rdquo;
Although the journey has not been easy, the more I learn, the stranger the journey becomes. Why? Because the principles I am learning: agility, visibility, code reuse and yes, even serverless, helped me see beyond the unknown and find my path.</description>

      <description>Some people learn by reading. Some by watching videos. Apparently I learn by failing and head-desking.
Learn how I super charged my Ops tooling with the power of CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps and avoid the mistakes I made along the way.
While my tooling is PowerShell based, my aim is to show how easy it can be to leverage Azure DevOps services for almost any use case.</description>

      <description>Modern environment uses a lot of the Linux networking stack capability.
Every docker container requires a dedicated bridge, usually a few iptables entries to expose port, and a dnsmasq daemon, and masquarading to allow internet access.
It is hence important to understand Linux network fundumentals. From the driver interrupt/NAPI, to the network stack, the various filters it passes through and the various hooks you have at your disposal to alter and view the network packets flow.</description>

      <description>Creating a more diverse tech workspace requires a different kind of &amp;ldquo;pipeline&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; one that creates tech curiosity and a sense of mastery in underrepresented teammates from an early age.
Commodity hardware and DevOps principles can play a role.
I&amp;rsquo;ll share how $65 of pre-integrated parts, small batch sizes and limiting WIP resulted in squeals of delight from my six-year-old daughter as she learned she could code, deploy, test and iterate until the software and hardware did what she wanted it to.</description>

      <description>I’ve recently had the pleasure of growing our DevOps team. Over the last few months I’ve reviewed hundreds of resumes and had dozens of interviews with all types of candidates. Developers, SysAdmins, Students, PHD’s, and a few DevOps Engineers. I’ve worked with recruiters as well as direct to hire candidates.
In this talk, I’m going to go over a few things that you should and shouldn’t do when trying to land that perfect gig.</description>

      <description>The OSS movement has brought free, high quality, reusable software to the masses, but much of this code and the way it&amp;rsquo;s stored and consumed is insecure. Nowhere is this better exemplified than in npm, the world&amp;rsquo;s largest repository of open-source software. In this talk, learn about the specific challenges faced by the JavaScript community, and the things we&amp;rsquo;re doing to try and save us from ourselves.
The problem with security is that it&amp;rsquo;s almost always an afterthought.</description>

      <description>When the term Observability came up we were all told that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to care about our systems anymore. We should move all of our infrastructure to the cloud, into containers and finally serverless will solve not only all our monitoring issues but all other things as well. Reality shows that this is not the case for most of us. While the importance of observability is given, we should not forget about everything we learned to make our monitoring suck less.</description>

      <description>Muchas veces vemos a los contenedores como pequeñas máquinas virtuales, pero en realidad se asemejan más a un viejo y querido Jail. En escencia, no son más que un proceso con restricciones especiales corriendo a la par del resto de nuestro sistema. Esta charla es el puntapié para que nos detengamos a pensar cómo realmente están implementados, y qué es lo que eso implica en un escenario del mundo real. Está dirigida a técnicos, y esperamos que ayude a sentar una base para poder adoptar un modelo sano de contenedores en ambientes de producción, asentando los conceptos necesarios para tomar las decisiones de arquitectura mejor balanceadas.</description>

      <description>With smaller teams, it’s often easier to deliver efficient, consistent software. But when your team grows to 100 or even 1000, delivering software can be a communication obstacle course. The solution to this lies in the open-source world, where 1000s of developers produce some of the best software on the planet. Learn about open-source best practices and how to apply them within your own teams.</description>

      <description>Automation is a big part of DevOps, but are you practicing DevOps if you do not automate every single thing? I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about where automation fits into DevOps, how to go about scripting &amp;ldquo;all the things&amp;rdquo; and why sometimes it is not necessary. Personal story of how one Ruby script saved me and my friends a bunch of time that could be used to do things slightly more exciting than copy/pasting to spreadsheets.</description>

And virtually all of them are at risk of successfully building the wrong thing two weeks at a time because they fail to include the implementation of a healthy Product Management Culture.</description>

      <description>A lot of companies have a vision and mission statement and in addition to that, they also have company core values. However most companies are forgetting a very important next step. Translate those core values into concrete behaviours. When you’re not making these values more tangible, it can stay fuzzy for your colleagues. Because everyone has his own beliefs and values and therefore a slightly different perspective when it comes to a value and therefore shows different behaviours.</description>

Many companies start their DevOps journey by creating ‘a DevOps team’ but the transformation stalls there. They want all the benefits of CI/CD automation without putting in the work of a total DevOps culture transformation.</description>

I had to pleasure of giving my first conference talk ever at an event about this topic of &amp;ldquo;how to retain your hardest to hire positions&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>From years in the trenches of “test automation,” I found it broken by inefficiency, poor communication, and quality risk. I discovered and recorded the patterns of MetaAutomation to fix it and make quality feedback much faster, more reliable, richer, and more valuable across the larger team and distributed teams. The most fundamental change is to take a pattern that we all use in our daily lives, and apply it as we drive and measure the SUT to record all that valuable data and make it available to other parts of the quality automation problem space in a way that isn’t possible with the practices of today.</description>

      <description>Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are a simple and useful way to define and measure reliability. They may not seem very powerful at first, but behind the simplicity lies a lot of potential if you decide to explore it. The Google Photos team has been using SLOs extensively over the past few years and they have become the foundation for discussing reliability across the SRE, devs, and PMs. We started with a few basic principles and the rest has been a process of discovering how to best use them in practice.</description>

      <description>What happens at your company when a service goes down? Hopefully an alarm fires somewhere and someone gets paged, but then what? Does the person who got paged fix it all themselves (and do they feel as isolated as that sounds)? What if they don’t know how- is there a procedure for them to get help? Do you have a protocol for deciding when the incident is over?
More and more, most of us work at companies that provide a service.</description>

      <description>Too many people think that pair programming is a boring waste of time and effort. I&amp;rsquo;m here to explain how our team made it work, and what benefits we got out of it!
I love working in a team, bouncing ideas off each other and using our combined strengths to produce something that as individuals we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to come up with.
One way I like to do this is pair programming.</description>

      <description>In the IT world, we often talk about &amp;ldquo;Yak Shaving&amp;rdquo; - term to describe a chain of tasks that seem unrelated, but which are required in order to accomplish your primary goal.
When I mentioned this term to a group of well-seasoned knitters, they all exclaimed that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t shave yaks. I was quickly informed that yak fiber (the industry term for yak hair) is one of the most expensive and prized materials to knit with.</description>

      <description>During this talk I will demonstrate how to shorten the time distance from the typical Redis setup to the end user. Reducing that latency typically results in faster, more responsive applications and therefore happier users. This revised architecture will make use of recently launched services which will frictionless run our containers (Redis k8s) closer to our users while keeping our primary data stores and code untouched. This talk will also cover running Redis on containers (k8s) and the benefits of that portability.</description>

      <description>Our customers need branded URL in order to support their brand and increase click-through rate. The world is becoming secured and HTTPS is a must. Since there is no out of the box solution we had to build our own. In order to implement SSL for your customers, a complicated security process is needed involving different organizations units for both the client and us. This is how we solved the problem with Letsencrypt, docker, Redis, Nginx, resty-Lua and autossl module.</description>

      <description>This talk will go over what I’ve learned working in large companies from my strange adventure working with a bunch of MBAs in corporate strategy at Dell, to working with large companies as an industry analyst, to working with marketing and product people at large companies.
If you work at a small, cool company, you can skip this talk. The rest of us in large, slow moving companies that rely on meetings, email, and inbox 2,000 to get the daily work done need some therapy and advice for thriving in big, “dumb” companies.</description>

      <description>The paths to DevOps transformation failure are more plentiful than the roads to success. As a DevOps practitioner, you are passionate about change and familiar with the concepts, strategies and professionals that can make DevOps happen. But one of the keys to a successful transformation is executive buy-in and participation. How do you, as an engineer, talk to the CSuite?
In this talk, Maria O’Neill (CIO of the American Bureau of Shipping) will provide perspective on what a day-in-the-life of a CIO is like and more importantly provide perspective on how dumb the idea of DevOps can sound.</description>

      <description>Oftentimes, IT professionals think auditability and observability are separate concepts, when in fact, they’re two sides of the same coin. It’s the review of what happened and why - just from different perspectives and moments in time. The point is, building an auditable pipeline should also result in building an observable pipeline.
Most IT pros, however, think about observability in regards to the observability of an operational system. But what if we considered the observability of an internal organizational system instead?</description>

      <title>How we killed DevOps by creating a dedicated DevOps team</title>

      <description>In the early days of Netguru, we were a bunch of developers and didn’t even think of having a dedicated ops role - life was simple and easy. The company grew, so did our requirements and challenges, and that’s why we’ve decided to change this by introducing The DevOps Team. That’s also how we’ve entered a very dangerous path with a lot of obstacles related to technology, people, and culture.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time my colleague Daniil Markovich said that people end up in our occupation against their will
Because it&amp;rsquo;s hard to expect sensible results from forced people, we have no other choice but to push ourselves. That leads to so-called burnout and other problems.
My talk will not be dedicated to struggle with burnout, because burnout is usually diagnosed via its symptoms and not the cause. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about my personal experience that led me to a (limited) understanding of how our brains work.</description>

      <description>Developers are making a difference in the world. We are solving hundreds of tough world problems. We invent and build lots of products which solve customers needs. And the considerable part of it is solutions for B2B. We are solving operational and productivity problems for fields like marketing, sales, finance, etc. That is what we can do for the world, but who will care about our productivity and happiness?
That is time for a new evolution in Software development, and only developers can make it!</description>

      <description>What is time? Is it fixed or fluid; physical or philosophical; quantifiable, or completely questionable? These deep questions may never be answered, but one thing is clear: the measuring, recording, and interpretation of time is a fundamentally important mission for humanity. In the modern age of computing, the accurate reckoning of time across cities, countries, and even planets is performed by a fantastic patchwork of actors - from governments and corporations, to academicians and hackers of all colours.</description>

      <description>Все, ну или почти все используют мониторинг для предупреждения перегрузок и нехватки места на диске, а так же для других метрик с приложений и системы. Но с приходом публичных клаудов девопсам нужно мониторить так же еще и недогруз выделенных ресурсов, так как каждый байт или секунда на счету. Поговорим про опыт использования мониторинга не только как решение для наблюдения за инфраструктурой, но и как средство для оптимизации расходов в амазоне.</description>

      <description>The Docker democratization started long ago with developers. Containerization is very popular for stateless applications but nowadays databases are also becoming an important part of the customer CI/CD pipeline. Fortunately, Microsoft kept up by providing the support for MSSQL databases on Docker regardless the underlying operating system (Windows and Linux).
But implementing a CI/CD pipeline with SQL Server raises a lot of considerations from both Devs and Ops. This session aims to provide feedbacks and challenges we faced during the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline including a SQL database project and SQL Server containers in order to reduce the time-to-market for customers.</description>

      <description>The push for automation in our daily work brings up a moral dilemma of sorts, namely whether or not we have a responsibility to let people know that the work is being performed by code.
This dilemma has parallels to the early days of Lean/TPS where workers were encouraged to find improvements to the production systems even if it meant that the resulting efficiencies would lead to a lack of demand for skills.</description>

      <description>As a Woman in Tech, I’ve experienced my fair share of self-doubt. It wasn’t until a year or two ago that I learned of Imposter Syndrome, something clicked; like someone handed me a cheat sheet to a jigsaw puzzle. Since then I’ve been learning more about psychology and why people react in a certain way to situations and how my own mind fits into all of this. Nearly 70% of people in tech have said they’ve experience Imposter Syndrome in some way.</description>

Many companies have come face to face with adversity that is forcing them to reimagine their business and culture. These times require us to step up and be “Inclusive leaders”. This starts with creating a culture and space to have “Authentic Conversations”. This will be the start of what allows you to hear one another and develop solutions together.</description>

      <description>You know about DevOps, you know DevOps is right for your organization, but hey, what can you do? As an individual contributor or a team leader, your authority to transform your organization to DevOps is limited. But your influence is not! In this talk, Baruch will show how some proven influencing and negotiating techniques can be used to convince critical stakeholders in your organization in the necessity of DevOps. We look at the arguments, the techniques, and the small tricks, which work in particular situations with particular engineering and business leadership positions and will prepare you to deliver the message of DevOps most convincingly to each.</description>

      <title>Infraestrutura declarativa e GitOps - da teoria à prática</title>

      <description>Ferramentas de infraestrutura declarativa nunca foram tão populares. Terraform e AWS CloudFormation, por exemplo, permitem que você especifique qual é o estado desejado, e um processo automatizado realiza os passos necessários para que o estado em produção reflita a especificação.
Infra declarativa também é a base da configuração da ferramenta mais popular de orquestração de containers hoje: o Kubernetes. E através da comunidade do Kubernetes que um novo padrão, chamado de GitOps, surgiu e têm-se mostrado promissor.</description>

      <description>Managing a broad array of infra resources can be challenging as a company grows. But with the adoption of infrastructure-as-code, documenting your resources and maintaining your standards is far more manageable.
At Instacart we&amp;rsquo;ve gone all-in on Infrastructure-as-code with Terraform on AWS. This includes more than 50 RDS Postgres instances and PGBouncers. Migrating to Terraform is a big investment and RDS instances are particularly complex to describe and manage. In two years of using Terraform, the Infrastructure team and data store working groups at Instacart have automated and refined management of our resources in Terraform.</description>

      <description>DevOps adoptions usually includes an evolution of processes and tool chains that enable these teams to function optimally. Modern day computing and infrastructure management is definitely shifting away from “ClickOps” management and adopting the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) way of doing business. IaC enables teams to easily define, deploy and maintain compute infrastructures in the form of code. It also provides the ability to effortlessly scale, version and audit infrastructure resources.</description>

      <description>A large application landscape, handling 96.000 requests per minute has been successfully migrated to the cloud. That migration was not only about focussing on the application. While we applied an lift&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;shift approach to the application, managing the target infrastructure became crucial. We needed to make sure that a team of 40 people was able to reproduce environments consistently across many geographies. Introducing Infrastructure as code was one of the best decisions we made.</description>

      <description>The common challenges a company faces during the migration of its systems to the cloud are often: business continuity, data integrity and security. In order to face these challenges, the implementation of infrastructure as code greatly facilitates migration processes.
Infrastructure as code provides the ability to configure, launch and scale platforms in the cloud giving organizations the ability to iterate faster than ever before. However, before the benefits of implementing infrastructure such as code to migrate your products to the cloud can be reaped, there are some challenges that need to be addressed.</description>

      <description>Our ability to build and maintain infrastructure has been made easier and faster by the introduction of technologies such as server virtualization, cloud platforms, container orchestrators, and configuration management frameworks. This has led to the mantra of “infrastructure as code”. Unfortunately, this abstraction is leaky and ignores the inherent statefulness of already deployed services.
Some of the challenges that arise when working on infrastructure as code are the inevitable refactorings and how they will interact with the current state of our environments.</description>

      <description>Overview A long-term benefit of having infrastructure described in code is increased maintainability. A goal of any infrastructure team should be to make it as easy as possible to change their infrastructure. Thus, sensible module-creation and versioning strategies for infrastructure code are important considerations for infrastructure teams.</description>

      <description>Software developers have been testing their code for years. Why is it still not a common thing for infrastructure and operations people? We are in the era of having to move fast but, as this could affect our customers, it&amp;rsquo;s vital that we ensure the changes we make to our infrastructure are tested like other code changes would be.
In this talk, Paul is going to demonstrate some of the methods of being able to test your infrastructure code.</description>

      <description>When working with DevSecOps, the biggest challenge may be how to integrate security into Dev and Ops functions. Traditional teams understand development and operations but bringing the department of &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo; in compliance security for highly-regulated industries can be more difficult. This session discusses some experience about building the basic discussions into your teams when integrating security practices. Starts with explaining the cyber threat landscape faced by today&amp;rsquo;s businesses and then expands to suggest ways to better integrate your security team while facing modern challenges.</description>

      <description>Intel has recently introduced a new capability called Intel Memory Failure Prediction (MFP). Intel® MFP uses machine learning to analyze server memory errors down to the DIMM, bank, column, row, and cell levels to generate a memory health score which can be used to predict potential failures. It’s a valuable tool to help customers analyze their hardware, and proactively make decisions on when to address a memory issue.
This capability helps by providing a detailed Realtime evaluation of memory health to improve several areas related to uptime:</description>

      <description>A deployment pipeline often consists of a Jenkins pipeline and a few commands to deploy a service. The problem with this is that most pipelines lack the intelligence necessary to make decisions based upon real-time data being generated.
The goal of the presentation is to provide an end to end example of how a deployment pipeline can become more intelligent. The talk will walk through some of the following areas.</description>

      <description>A deployment pipeline often consists of a Jenkins pipeline and a few commands to deploy a service. The problem with this is that most pipelines lack the intelligence necessary to make decisions based upon real-time data being generated. While not quite as bleeding edge as AI driven pipelines, it is a step in that direction where the pipeline knows how to make decisions using disparate data from the environment. The goal of the presentation is to provide an end to end example of how a deployment pipeline can become more intelligent by harnessing data that is already being captured in existing systems within the environment.</description>

      <description>When building reliable services unexpected user behavior can prove deadly. Yet few engineering teams make use of talent from their product and design orgs if they are working on something internal. This talk will demonstrate how a product mindset and design thinking can super charge technical discussions and build stronger systems. Don&amp;rsquo;t rely on the user to be &amp;ldquo;smart!&amp;rdquo; It can trap you in an impossible architecture.

      <description>Terraform is a declarative and powerful provisioning tool that has seen an explosion in use and supported technology since its initial release in July, 2014.
This technical presentation will walk through the basics of Terraform and interactively codify, create, and configure a small set of AWS resources. Intended audience is for those new to Terraform or Infrastructure as Code, but all are welcome (obviously!).</description>

      <description>Ao falarmos sobre observabilidade a reação mais comum é “O que é isso?”, mas também coisas como “Acabamos de lançar uma iniciativa de observabilidade mas ainda estamos descobrindo exatamente como fazer isso” e finalmente, algumas organizações já consideram observabilidade parte integrante de como projetam e constroem seus produtos e serviços. Dado que o termo ainda está ganhando força nessa palestra irei desmistificar o que é observabilidade para nós da Elastic, como nós entendemos isso e como utilizar o Stack com esse intuito.</description>

      <description>Learn how our organization improved delivery for 400+ engineers by investing in internal tools over the last 10 years. We will discuss what drove investment decisions, how changes were implemented and the impact of multiple initiatives.
During the discussion of multiple improvements we will cover numerous decisions:
 how to sell initiatives to decision-makers? develop tools grass-roots or with a dedicated role? are internal tools a product and what process should they follow?</description>

      <description>According to Phythian, DataOps is forecasted to be one of the top 7 Big Data Analytics trends in 2019. DataOps is a new data analytics technology in the modern digital world. Some feel DataOps is nothing but DevOps for data but it is even beyond that. In simple terms, you combine DevOps with data analytics to get DataOps. DataOps applies Agile and DevOps methods to the entire data analytics lifecycle. Though DevOps is not in the top list, it does not mean that DevOps has lost its flavor and not widely adopted.</description>

      <description>GitOps is about applying the Git workflow to operations. Said another way, it&amp;rsquo;s about applying a developer experience (DX) to ops. Developer experience for APIs, SDKs, CLIs, and docs tend to take up all of the oxygen in the room. However, I propose DX for ops is an idea whose time has come.</description>

      <description>If your company has a “DevOps” team, is that a step in the right direction or proof that you’ve totally missed the point? At FullStory we have a Platform team, which builds things to make life easier for the other engineering teams. Usually that works well; but sometimes, not so much.
What’s the proper role of a “DevOps” team? Or is any such team flawed by design?
At FullStory, we embrace “you build it, you run it”, but the specifics of how we implement this philosophy have evolved over time.</description>

      <description>Listen closely. Close your eyes. I know you hear it coming. It&amp;rsquo;s the microservices buzz. Well, by now it is more of a quake.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been on 2 enterprise level microservices implementations. One was greenfield and the other was a migration from a FAT service. It turns out that the 2 easiest things to do when moving to microservices are to DECIDE to do it and to WRITE THE CODE. If you stick around after that, you better be ready for a ride!</description>

      <description>Our agency has transitioned six major systems into our cloud infrastructure in Amazon Web Services, resulting in 20+ AWS linked accounts and 1 organization. We started in 2015 with only 1 standalone AWS account. How’d we grow to so many accounts in 5 years? Why’d we do it? Come learn about how our agency conceived of an “Islands in the Sky” model for system management in the cloud. We’ll discuss the importance of limiting your blast radius, the benefits of the AWS IAM model, the pain points of setting up cross account access properly, and how we learned to manage these things over time.</description>

      <description>As your applications become composed of more and more microservices, managing and coordinating all of those services can become difficult. Which services are communicating with each other? Are they communicating securely? And most importantly, how can you know?
This workshop will get you started creating a service mesh with Istio on Kubernetes. We’ll start the workshop by setting up Istio with a microservices application and reviewing some of the features that Istio provides.</description>

The movie Office Space depicted the software development culture in 1999. There has been a lot of cultural changes in the last 20 years, but communication is still very important. As we focus on Agile and DevOps, strong relationships across the business is crucial for success.
This talk will be a humorous look into the development lifecycle within our engineering and business organizations.</description>

      <title>Jenkins in the Cloud, lessons learned migrating to Kubernetes</title>
      <link>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-vancouver/program/shane-gearon/</link>

      <description>Today, we are running hundreds of builds a day, spread across twenty different Jenkins servers, in a mixture of environments, and my team has the difficult task of maintaining them all. In order to support our build needs, we decided to migrate everything into a single cloud based, scalable solution on Kubernetes.
Jenkins is going through a major transition to become cloud ready, but it’s definitely not there yet. If you’re interested in running Jenkins on the cloud, or even some form of containerized Jenkins, I hope you can learn from the mistakes we made, as well as some of the more interesting ways we made Jenkins work for us.</description>

      <description>I started my career doing traditional IT security at McAfee, in the days when servers where physical and you still had to screw in network plugs to the back of your computer. As virtual machines took over the world I joined VMware, and helped make servers, networks and storage software-defined. Then this cool little tool called Docker started popping up everywhere and I realized containers were going to change the world again and I was lucky enough to join Docker and be part of that revolution.</description>

      <description>I am a Continuous Delivery and DevOps consultant and teacher. I did not write the book on DevOps, but I did write the song for DevOpsDays Copenhagen. I help companies both with process and culture, but I do enjoy it when I can dive into the deep tech stuff. I am particular fond of Git, Jenkins, Artifactory and Gradle as a toolstack. I maintain Opinionated Git, Exploring Agile Newsletter and the best darn Git exercises around.</description>

Mi aproximación no es soft, me enfoco en lograr los resultados empresariales, entendiendo que si construimos una compañía sana y responsable sus empleados estarán bien. Gestiono ámbitos como la cultura y el mindset desde la gestión del entorno y las dinámicas empresariales, como por ejemplo, entendiendo que un equipo informado, con herramientas correctas y en sintonía con los objetivos tendrá todos los elementos necesarios para comportarse con empoderamiento, liderazgo y tomará decisiones, con líderes más confiados.</description>

Passionate about taking the legwork out of Operations, Joseph seeks to get infrastructure right the first time through careful planning, accounting for failure, and clean execution after recovery to guide tool selection; a lofty goal, but one he hopes becomes more achievable with enough process and predictability, and one that, in a very-distant (but hopefully nearing) future, signals the end of a need to ever be on-call, or re-architecture, again.</description>

      <description>DevOps principles &amp;amp; tools are great but if we want to make it to the Promised Land we need to change our perspective. Products are only as strong as their weakest link. Fire fighting is inevitable if operational concerns don&amp;rsquo;t include the critical internal services our applications rely on. As DevOps enthusiasts, we spend a lot of time discussing key principles, such as CI/CD Pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, and the variety of tools that support them, but when we get down to it, how do we actually achieve these?</description>

      <description>Juliano has been around since 1989. He grew playing basketball in a country that almost every single person loves football, yes he is Brazilian.
From 7 till 17 he has dedicated himself to the sport and he couldn’t see another outcome but starting a Physical Education course, once becoming a professional player wasn’t one of his options.
Although noticing that Physical Education was a lot more than just basketball during graduation, he decided to get the course done considering that he was in a good University and knowledge is never too much.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;So, you’re completely Agile now. Your retros are humming and produce actionable improvements. Your demos slay the audience. Your goals are met. Your teams are jamming together. Your team ships features weekly, daily, even hourly. Okay, maybe they ship code a little TOO fast, really, and the business would LOVE a hand brake — sometimes — for the release of these fantastic features and get early feedback from a subset of customers and other stakeholders.</description>

      <description>Most cloud engineers are familiar with the paradigm of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), which provides the ability to model and deploy your cloud infrastructure via code, or code-generated configuration files. IaC drastically reduces the reliance on manual processes such as creating separate configurations for multiple environments, helps minimize misconfiguration mistakes through automated testing and version control, and can significantly speed up deployment times through CI/CD pipelines.
Implementing IaC at scale still requires significant investment, and many companies have teams dedicated to the management and deployment of their cloud infrastructure.</description>

      <description>Kat Cosgrove is a chronic early-adopter of new technologies and a real-life cyborg. Her professional engineering background is in web development, IoT, and programming education, but today she&amp;rsquo;s a Developer Advocate for JFrog. She loves finding creative solutions for hard problems, especially if they&amp;rsquo;re a little hacky.
When she&amp;rsquo;s not building demos or at a conference, she spends her time gaming, watching e-sports, and working on useless but entertaining side-projects. She also volunteers with area non-profits geared towards getting more women and other underrepresented minorities into tech.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes is becoming the standard in container orchestration but tooling is still lagging behind more mature environments. While that’s true, the community has rallied behind this technology and has started to develop tools to help develop, manage and deploy Kubernetes ready applications. This talk aims to introduce tools like Telepresence to improve development by allowing easy interfacing with Kubernetes deployed services, Skaffold to automate builds and deploys and Helm to manage deploys.</description>

      <description>When things blow up, what do we do? Drop everything &amp;amp; jump right in to investigate. Sometimes leaving an agitated customer support rep, account manager or some other non-tech person in the dark for a long time. We can and should do better.
I this short talk I will present a couple easy ways to be more transparent during an emergency, and make a case on why the time wasted^W used on comms as opposed to staying on the task at hand could pay off big time.</description>

Many industries have discovered that if you have nothing else, having a plan and working together will allow cool heads to prevail and reliably follow the steps needed to get back up and running quickly.</description>

      <description>The Knative open-source project promises to simplify how we build, deploy, and manage Serverless workloads on top of Kubernetes. We’ll discuss how Knative is attempting to address the promises of Serverless through the creation of their Build, Serving, and Eventing primitives.
Knative is a new open-source project with contributions from IBM, Google, Pivotal, and other industry leaders with deep experience in building their own Serverless platforms. This project promises to simplify how we build, deploy, and manage Serverless workloads on top of Kubernetes.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes excels at container scheduling, and offers useful primitives for automating infrastructure. But we’ve noticed that development teams often struggle when they use vanilla Kubernetes for application deployments. By all means, use Kubernetes to push containers all day long. But if you want to push application code — or a function — Kubernetes on its own isn’t enough.
Knative is an open source software layer that helps cloud service providers and enterprise platform operators deliver a serverless experience to developers on any cloud.</description>

      <description>Everyone keeps telling you that containers need orchestration, but you&amp;rsquo;re not so sure; maybe they could go for some light jazz? Or maybe serverless is here to save us from the tyranny of (virtual) machines, but meanwhile somebody&amp;rsquo;s gotta kuber some netes, and it&amp;rsquo;s likely to be you. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a walk through the cloud native landscape and talk about what&amp;rsquo;s new, what&amp;rsquo;s next, and what you need to get started with Kubernetes right now (before sentient machines have a chance to destroy us all).</description>

      <description>Artisanally hand-crafting our own container hosting solutions can be a fun learning experience, but for repeatable production use, let&amp;rsquo;s look at how to deploy and manage Kubernetes in a reproducible fashion.
Using Terraform, Helm, Draft, Brigade, Duffle, and more, we can deploy and update our Kubernetes clusters (AKS in my case; your mileage may vary!) and applications via a trusted, versioned, consistent process. The Kubernetes ecosystem is a complex space with a baffling array of options; we&amp;rsquo;ll look at a subset with an eye to repeatable &amp;ldquo;day two&amp;rdquo; operations.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes makes it possible to run containerized application at scale. It solves many problems of microservice architecture by abstracting away things like container deployment, container-to-container communication, load balancing. While Kubernetes is great at it many things, it seems to be lacking in terms of security. It has some security features but in most respect it is not production grade security, at least not by default.
If you are thinking about or already started with Kubernetes for your production workload, there are some steps you could follow to make sure your environments sand applications is secure.</description>

      <description>Microservices revolutionized the way we look at app development and is now one of the most popular programming architectures. Now, Docker alongside Kubernetes is changing the way teams look at deployments of these microservices. Kubernetes provides powerful production-grade orchestration for your “Dockerized” microservices.
In this workshop, you’ll get an overview of Kubernetes, and what it provides for application development. You’ll then go through the process of building and deploying a microservice application on Kubernetes.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes has become the new darling of the infrastructure world. Not only is it a great piece of technology for managing your containers, but in conjunction with the possibility to rent managed clusters from any of the big Cloud providers, Kubernetes offers organisations the possibility to get rid of the shackles of hosting and/or managing one’s infrastructure. But that does not mean that Kubernetes is a one-size-fits-all solution. Especially in big corporations, bigger, systemic and/or more pressing problems could be revealed while implementing a big shift like moving to the cloud.</description>

In this talk we’ll introduce Kubernetes, discuss the key concepts of the platform, it’s high level architecture and how to get a Kubernetes cluster up and running in minutes in Azure.
We’ll talk about and demo deploying .NET applications to Kubernetes and we’ll finish with a discussion of the future where you can deploy both legacy and modern .</description>

      <description>The purpose is to explain quickly what Kubernetes does best, it’s major issues, understand how it became so popular so fast and ensure you make an informed decision about whether you should be using it as your solution or not. K8S is a complex and powerful tool, and like any other devops tools it has pros and cons, and those have to be pondered before a team commits to a migration.</description>

      <description>There are many different ways to deploy and operate Kubernetes ranging from DIY solutions such as Rancher to fully managed solutions like GKE. As Kubernetes has continued to mature and grow in prominence, the way we as developers deploy Kubernetes has changed as well. As we continue down this devops journey, we find a gradual convergence on managed solutions for Kubernetes.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes is probably the de-facto container orchestrator for most people using container orchestrators. There is a huge demand for it as well as a lot of interest among people to learn Kubernetes. I like most people wanted to learn how it all worked. And don’t get me wrong the docs for Kubernetes are great. The community as a whole also created many tutorials, blog posts, videos books etc. But I still find something is missing.</description>

      <description>Theodore Roosevelt una vez citó: ~~ &amp;ldquo;Cuanto más sepa sobre su pasado, mejor preparado estará para el futuro.&amp;quot;
La primera pregunta que muchas personas me han hecho es, “¿Que herramientas necesito saber para hacer DevOps?” Muchos creen que, porque conocen algunas de las herramientas que se utilizan para automatizar, hacer prueba, seguridad, y otras, que ellos están implementando los conceptos DevOps.
En esta presentación le hablaremos un poco de la historia, cambios estructurales, y la visión detrás de DevOps para que entiendan que las herramientas son una pequeña parte del movimiento cultural de DevOps.</description>

      <description>DevOps transformational efforts are challenged. In a survey of over 3000 corporate executives, two-thirds reported that their organizations failed to achieve intended performance improvements following organizational change initiatives (Meany &amp;amp; Pung, 2008). In addition, another study (Grady &amp;amp; Grady 2013) concluded that 68% of organizational change efforts fail or experience serious challenges. Adopting DevOps practices goes beyond process and technology usage requiring a transformational change to address cultural issues that create barriers to DevOps adoption.</description>

This is an opportunity to co-create the futures in our industries together &amp; provide some contrast to the outcomes of the devopsdays + map camp + serverlessdays Atlanta 2019 event on April 9th &amp; 10th.</description>

      <description>There were a lot of things asked of me as a one man dev shop within the District of Connecticut, but the most outrageous one was to scale out a legacy ColdFusion application into something that could be used by courts across the country.
Along the way I managed myself how to use Docker, OpenShift, and eventually ColdFusion. (/rimshot)
Most importantly, though, I learned how big an impact culture has on the success of big objectives.</description>

      <title>Leading Agile Transformations: A House Divided Cannot Stand</title>

      <description>Agile transformations are complicated endeavors, especially for large enterprises trying to keep pace with today’s fluid digital marketplace. For change to be sustainable, it cannot be led in a vacuum. Both the right and left hand sides of delivery much adapt accordingly. Most practitioners have only led agile transformations from one side of the house: IT or Business. But a house divided cannot stand. This talk offers revelations from one person who has led transformations as both a product owner and scrum master.</description>

      <description>Healthy collaboration and engagement are one of the number one success factors of modern projects. But such team behaviour doesn’t necessarily comes out of nowhere - it requires conscious effort from people, who want to take ownership and drive the projects’ success. Leading without Authority is a style, that supports such behaviour and doesn’t require formal authority. It’s an effective and helpful approach for people that want to increase their impact or leaders that seek to create a healthy and high-performing team.</description>

      <description>Have you been blamed for an outage? Was the root cause &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;Human Error?&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; Running software services is hard. We all work with complex systems that fail in different ways. How can we reduce the impact of future failures? By learning from other industries we can improve the services we run. Attendees will learn the following:
 Why we experience failures Why Five whys and RCA methods should not be used Etsy&amp;rsquo;s Open Source Debriefing Method How to facilitate learning sessions How to improve from failures How not to jump into &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;fix it now&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; mode  This talk will be useful for any teams that experience failures - whether they are large or small, distributed, or cross-functional.</description>

      <description>Writing code is like learning how to ride a bike. Once you’re good at it, you never really forget the skill. After having a 30 plus IT career starting as a programmer writing in assembler and Fortan, then moving up the ladder to be a systems analyst, systems designer, dba, project manager, and then an enterprise manager, taking the opportunity to try IOS app development was a little scary, but a lot of fun.</description>

      <description>Surveiller une application complexe n&amp;rsquo;est pas une tâche aisée, mais avec les bons outils, ce n&amp;rsquo;est pas si sorcier. Néanmoins, des périodes fortes telles que les opérations de type &amp;ldquo;Black Friday&amp;rdquo; (Vendredi noir) ou période de Noël peuvent pousser votre application aux limites de ce qu&amp;rsquo;elle peut supporter, ou pire, la faire crasher. Parce que le système est fortement sollicité, il génère encore davantage de logs qui peuvent également mettre à mal votre système de supervision.</description>

      <title>Less Ops with Serverless? But how less?</title>
      <link>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-berlin/program/emrah-samdan/</link>

      <description>For the first years of the serverless era, shift to serverless was misunderstood as getting rid of operational concerns because the vendor takes care of scalability of the application. It certainly adds efficiency to software teams and reduces the need for ops people who are dedicated to keep the systems up and running. However, it doesn’t directly mean firing ops people and hiring more serverless developers instead. Ops people have their chance of being indispensable to their team by adopting their ops characteristics to the serverless world.</description>

      <description>At the beginning of the second world war, the US Navy faced a drastic shortage of torpedoes. With the war rapidly escalating, they needed to build their supply quickly and under a tight budget. But given the old adage, “fast, good, cheap: pick two,” this resulted in a torpedo plagued with problems.
In this ignite, I’ll share the story of the Mark 14 torpedo and how it went from an absolute failure to become one of the Navy’s standard munitions for over 40 years.</description>

      <description>As developers, we solve problems. Working on interesting problems and solving interesting puzzles is where many of us get our job satisfaction. It’s easy to get caught up in that feeling, always pushing forward and asking ourselves “Can we build it?” Unfortunately, that can often overshadow an even more important question: “Should we build it?”
Engineering ethics has been a hot ticket item in tech lately, but it can be a difficult topic to talk about.</description>

      <description>Over the last decade, I’ve had the privilege professionally of building and cultivating some Open Source projects and communities. To start off this isn’t a tools talk, this is a talk about the soft skills you have to have to be able to succeed as a leader in an Open Source project. My journey started tending the frequently asked questions for a small Linux Distribution called CRUX, and then years later professionally moved to the OpenStack-Chef project to build OpenStack clouds.</description>

      <description>At Facebook, we have a large internal network spawning multiple datacenters, over multiple geographic regions across multiple continents. This means a large number of devices and links to monitor. We have been developing a bunch of different strategies to make sure our network is healthy, from SNMP counters collection to sophisticated synthetic traffic injection tools. The aim of this talk is to review how we approached the problem over the years, how we dealt with common problems in the monitoring space but, most importantly, what we learned while doing so, and how we applied those concepts to other problems.</description>

      <description>Lets face it - we are all liars. We often lie unintentionally and most of all - we lie to ourselves. I’ve spent the last 10 years working with enterprise architects intent on modernizing their data infrastructure, and I’ve heard many “facts&amp;quot; that turned out to be… less than perfectly accurate. Self-deception about state of the industry, our requirements and our capabilities can lead us to make bad choices, which leads us to build bad architectures and often leads to bad business outcomes.</description>

   HORÁRIO DE CHEGADA Se possível, evite chegar na sexta-feira, em horário de pico (17h às 19h). Como toda capital, Vitória tem um trânsito intenso e o fato de ser uma ilha, com apenas algumas pontes ligando ao continente, contribui para a lentidão.

      <title>Logging is a Team Sport: How to Work within Your Org to Log Well</title>

      <description>Logging is deceptively simple. You import a library, pass strings to it, and BAM you have logs. However, getting decent, machine-parsable logs is hard because most people don’t understand the value of good logging. Logging is an underutilized tool in the developer’s toolbox, and it is often misunderstood as just another unnecessary debugging tool. In reality, logging is a boon to the people who will be working on a system later down the line, and making fantastic logs really is a team sport.</description>

      <description>Falar sobre a importância dos logs e sua utilidade, pode parecer clichê até a primeira violação de segurança de um dado logado ou mesmo, um dado importante que não foi extraído e gerou prejuízos milionários. Estes são alguns exemplos que justificam a adoção de boas práticas desde a criação, extração e monitoramento através dos logs. Nesta apresentação, traremos de maneira didática algumas vivências de projetos reais e pretendemos debater sobre as práticas de DevOps no sucesso dos projetos com um bom monitoramento através dos logs no contextos de sistemas distribuidos.</description>

      <description>Todos sabemos a importância que o tratamento adequado de logs tem, ainda mais em ambientes cada vez mais complexos e heterogêneos. Mas será que levamos tão a sério assim este elemento tão importante?
Nessa talk traremos a importância dos Logs e seu papel fundamental na melhora contínua dos nossos serviços e produtos, apresentando como podemos ser efetivos na hora de: interpretar a experiência do usuário; observar e entender o comportamento das nossas aplicações; como obter insumos para tomada de decisões em nossos produtos, e quanto pode nos custa essa prática.</description>

      <description>Managing and leading teams to embrace Agile and DevOps, and make it a way of life that will drive business value, is challenging. Managing and working among remote teams adds a layer of complexity that ensures new and interesting challenges will also become a way of life. I would like to share the trials and successes of building a new remote office, hiring and retaining talent, increasing stakeholder and engineer delight, and removing the miles between our employees.</description>

      <description>The documentation: it is written. Written, edited, reviewed, revised, re-reviewed, approved, approved again, and then published. Success! Thank everything we never have to do that again. Or do we? In a rapidly changing technological world, of course we do.
We’ve all had the experience of trying to find documentation for something we’re trying to use and discovering that it’s out-of-date, for a previous version, no longer relevant, or for features that no longer exist.</description>

      <title>Looking Back At 10 Years Of DevOps</title>

      <description>10 years ago we had the idea to organise a conference in Gent to bridge the gap between developers and the people runing their code. It was the start of a new global movement. We never predicted that #devops would be where #devops is today. The word devops has evolved, the community has evolved. Over the years the word devops lost it’s meaning at least it’s original meaning. The real challenge for the next decade will be to see how we can revive those original values and ideas, if at all… Can we fix Devops?</description>

      <description>Ms. Guido had a 30 plus IT career doing DevOps before it was called DevOps. She started as a programmer writing in multiple languages, developing applications for vastly different projects. Then she moved up the ladder to become a systems analyst, systems designer, dba, project manager, enterprise manager, and finally vendor manager. Near the end of her federal career, Ms. Guido jumped at the opportunity to be an IOS app developer showing you can switch careers/technologies successfully.</description>

      <description>Problem: Knowledge frustration is when siloed knowledge blocks you from doing your job. Yes, you can escalate or bother another coworker, but wouldn’t it be better if you had the instructions you needed when you needed it? Knowledge frustration is common for new people getting up to speed, experienced people moving between projects, and oncall engineers that receive an alert they’ve never seen before.
Solution: In this talk, I’ll show how to use the anthropology concept of high-context/low-context societies to eliminate knowledge frustration on DevOps/SRE teams.</description>

      <description>Como pesquisadora, percebo que é comum o foco na construção do modelo de machine learning em si. O ambiente é geralmente controlado, com dados limpos, classes definidas. Visto que o nosso objetivo e nosso produto é a pesquisa. Porém, há um tempo atrás, um de meus alunos me questionou: Como se coloca o método de machine learning para funcionar na vida real e integrado com o meu sistema? Isso reflete uma dúvida comum para quem vem estudando machine learning.</description>

      <description>On réduit souvent DevOps au déploiement d’outils permettant le provisionning automatique de l’infrastructure et le déploiement rapide de nouvelles fonctionnalités. Cependant, ces nouvelles possibilités, couplées à l’introduction de nouvelles pratiques comme l’IaC, permettent de donner de l’ampleur à notre transformation DevOps.
Mais voilà, après quelques mois, la fréquence des livraisons est en chute libre et la tension entre les équipes s’est accrue : les Ops grognent à cause des 5 derniers déploiements ratés, et les Devs taclent les Ops pour leur ignorance de l’architecture microservice.</description>

      <description>How many different silos is your organization at the mercy of? How much time theft occurs from chasing down information across disparate systems?The hardest thing we do is communicate across teams. Discovering what’s going on and where things are at is a challenge when work flows are disconnected.
In order to solve these problems, it&amp;rsquo;s useful to find &amp;amp; fix the fragmented work – the broken handoffs – the disconnected communication (communication debt) that occurs between different people across the value stream.</description>

      <description>With the introduction of cross-functional teams, our old on-call system stopped working. In an experiment, we moved from a mandatory to a voluntary on-call rotation. It not only worked surprisingly well but we also gained some unexpected insights, for example, that the burden of being on-call can be significantly reduced by moving from weekly to daily rotations. In this ignite I will present our five main learnings from the experiment, both positive and negative.</description>

      <description>As software engineers, we often see our world in binaries, enums, and defined values. The reality of the world is that there are entire swaths of our society who do not fit neatly within our defined parameters. Gender is not always binary. Race cannot always be described with a radio button. Visually impaired users may not be able to navigate through our forms. Whether we are advocating for more inclusivity in design meetings or driving actual changes to how our data is stored or presented, software developers are uniquely positioned to create forms and documents that increase the inclusion of marginalized populations.</description>

      <description>Out of the box code scanning tools are not being used to best advantage and aren’t always fit for purpose. The integrated tools don’t scan SQL code and the standalone scanner takes too long, throws up too many code violations and re-scans files that have already been scanned. As a result, code quality wasn’t measurable and developers couldn’t tell if their changes made the code worse. Empathy: We pushed for a set of rules because it’s not reasonable to review code created by a hundred hands without a clear set of expectations on the developer and reviewer.</description>

      <description>While no one disputes the good in finding and fixing issues before deploying to production, relying on traditional testing methods in the age of data-intensive, internet scale software has proven to be incomplete. The ability to identify and fix production issues quickly is crucial and requires insight into usage patterns and trends across the entire application architecture. This talk touches on deficiencies of common testing methods, provide real-world examples of discovering odd edge cases with both testing and monitoring, and offers recommendations on metric instrumentation to help companies identify and act on business-affecting problems.</description>

      <description>DevOps literature expounds on the fact that “DevOps is a Culture”. The C.A.L.M.S. acronym (Culture, Automation, Lean, Metrics, Sharing) reminds us that the organizational attributes that contribute to successful DevOps are fundamental and shared across teams. The message is clear: DevOps is not the job of one person or a group of people, and it can’t succeed unless the whole org is involved and on-board. There are no DevOps Engineers! Everyone is a DevOps Engineer!</description>

      <description>The industry is moving away from large monolithic apps in favor of small, focused microservices that speed up implementation and improve resiliency. Microservices and containers changed application design and deployment patterns, but along with them brought challenges like service discovery, routing, failure handling, security and visibility to microservices. But something even more subtle happened at the DevOps level. Weekly deployments are becoming a thing of the past and quick and fast deployments are happening daily even hourly.</description>

In this talk, we will discuss a wide variety of constraints we considered or discovered and our workarounds or concessions for handling them. Specifically, we will talk about our experiences with: circumventing API Gateway timeouts and concurrent invocation limits experienced during load testing, contending with dependency artifact max size limits during deployment, minimizing cold start times (plus the subsequent maximum execution duration limits that resulted from it), and handling Glue ETL issues experienced when attempting to point Glue Crawlers to s3 artifacts generated from kinesis streams.</description>

      <description>Software development luminaries have been predicting the demise of &amp;lsquo;manual testing&amp;rsquo; as a discipline for more than a decade. It&amp;rsquo;s true that delivering software today looks very little like it did in 2009, and nothing at all as it did in 1999. Is manual testing one of those practices that has gone by the wayside? Perhaps more importantly, SHOULD it be left to history given all the capabilities we have now around automation and observability and machine learning?</description>

      <description>Once you have a strategy, you need to get your team on board. Who can help you implement your strategy? Who might be an obstacle, or enemy? Samo Burja’s Empire Theory provides a framework for mapping power. After this talk, you’ll be able to start mapping power in your organization and beyond.
In recent months, I’ve developed a new kind of strategic mapping: Burja Mapping (alternatively, power or empire mapping). Samo Burja is a sociologist and the founder of Bismarck Analysis, which analyzes institutions, from governments to companies.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;How are you doing?&amp;rdquo; is a question that is frequently asked but seldom heard. In our busy lives today working to solve devops related problems, many of us put aside &amp;ldquo;everything else&amp;rdquo;, to spend more time solving the problems with Kubernetes clusters, or writing code to minimize on call burdens. Then, we realize we&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;burned out&amp;rdquo;, and take time to fix ourselves. We notice coworkers completely burned out and realize they aren&amp;rsquo;t themselves anymore.</description>

      <description>This Ignite talk advocates for DevOps engineers to show off their misunderstandings in the name of demonstrating their expertise! DevOps is fundamentally about change - creating change, recognizing change, managing the effects of intended and unintended change&amp;hellip; you get the picture, so it stands to reason you need to continually update your mental model of how the system functions under variable load conditions, how it interacts with dependent services and how it degrades.</description>

      <description>Creating and delivering a good talk talk is difficult. Like many other crafts, it requires a combination of skill and style—both of which are honed through practice. In this ignite, I’ll share what I’ve learned about writing and delivering compelling ignite talks at dozens of DevOpsDays around the world. I’ll also touch on why ignites are so valuable to DevOpsDays and lessons we can apply to DevOps.</description>

      <description>At eBay, we have been using different versions of the same central monitoring platform for ~15 years. The teams at eBay rely heavily on this platform to monitor their applications and infrastructure. This platform is so deeply ingrained into our applications and systems that it is non-trivial to replace it.
As the team managing this central monitoring platform, it is our responsibility to maintain, enhance and ensure its availability for our customers.</description>

      <description>Join us as we describe our migration from a limiting cloud deployment on long-running VMs with shared infrastructure to a streamlined immutable infrastructure built on top of Docker and K8s. We&amp;rsquo;ll also discuss techniques to support local development during this transition.
Many teams wish they could reap the widely known benefits of Kubernetes (K8s), but most struggle to migrate to a new infrastructure while simultaneously supporting two deployment models and avoiding impacts to the velocity of software development.</description>

      <description>Speaker A development is the key - multi directional, dynamic, coordinated. That’s why I administrate, program, take photos. Sometimes I write stories and I tale stories from very far worlds. I think, that world is too interesting to close on any of its aspects. I’m professionally IT engineer, I’m interested in IT administration and system engineering. I’ve also worked with developers teams as IT administrator.</description>

Como agencia gubernamental dirigida a la exploración científica, la NASA libera tecnología con el objetivo de hacerla más accesible al resto de mortales. En este caso hablaremos de la versión web del Mission Control Center que utiliza actualmente la NASA para el seguimiento de sus misiones en el espacio. Desde el equipo de SREs de Payvision hemos creado una prueba de concepto para incorporar Open MCT en nuestro stack de observabilidad y queremos compartir la experiencia con otros desarrolladores, estudiantes y analistas que tengan interés en conocer las herramientas que utilizamos para analizar y optimizar el comportamiento de nuestros sistemas en producción.</description>

      <description>Quality decisions need to be made without full analysis and include uncertainty. Patterns exist. Comparing a new problem to an existing model can help elude analysis paralysis. A 2010 study by LexisNexis showed, “on average, employees spend more than half their workdays receiving and managing information rather than using it to do their jobs!” Recognizing what models we may be using to validate our gut instincts may help us find more models to expand our capabilities</description>

      <description>The first product build specifically for Continuous Delivery pipelines came out over 10 years ago. The Continuous Delivery book came out 9 years ago. In the time since we&amp;rsquo;ve seen massive changes in the types of software we&amp;rsquo;re building, testing and deploying. Yet the way we think about pipelines hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed in many cases.
Now that we as an industry are trying to think &amp;ldquo;cloud first&amp;rdquo; what changes does that imply in our architecture?</description>

      <description>At ThoughtWorks we pride ourselves in learning from our mistakes. To make this easier, we’ve made some big ones!
This talk will tell the stories of 3 different real projects which have transformed not only the way we work, but large portions of our industry as well.
In the first story, we learned the hard way about the importance of deploying to a production like environment as often as possible. We were proud of our development practices, but had not learned yet about the importance of the “last mile”.</description>

      <description>This is our true story of juggling hot potatoes. In other words - the why and the how of a modern incident management process in the fast-paced world of online media.
Media-focused products have one thing in common - high-velocity deployment environments. From that perspective, we want to show how our 50 teams have dealt with performance issues, outages, errors, etc.. since the 90’s. We want to share with you why we built a whole automation process around our incident management in the first place, and why we implemented DevOps culture across our organization.</description>

      <description>The next generation of IT solutions delivery starts with a cloud-first approach. Everything is being pushed toward programmatic delivery, a.k.a. “IT as Code”. This IT teams to know how to connect together APIs, build cloud native templates, use developer-focused tools, and adopt DevOps methodologies for delivering solutions to their stakeholders. Nirvana world would be to fill in the missing link: the ability to provide repeatable solution blueprints that can be adapted to their ongoing business requirements.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;To address the need for speed, new agile pipeline platforms take advantage of automation and scalability. This vast complexity - and all of its dependencies - create a pressure cooker for performance issues, reactive event management, and all of the potential business risks that can come along with it.
This new world demands a re-invention of operations as we know it. The enterprise is drowning in the many collections of data from a bunch of different tools, hundreds of thousands of email alerts – all adding pressure to already critical situations where time is of the essence.</description>

      <description>Some of the common question engineers have around monitoring are, “Why should I monitor my service?”, “How do I monitor my service?” and “What tools do I use to do this?”. In this talk we will go through some of the key reasons for us to monitor our services and systems. We will then see some methods like the USE(Utilisation, Saturation and Error) and RED(Rate Error Duration) methods that help us identify what to monitor in a consistent manner.</description>

      <description>The advent of Cloud Native architectures means our applications have become smaller and simpler, without any catches; right?
Wrong.
Migrating to microservices removes the complexity that comes with monolithic applications, allowing for faster builds, easier deployments, simpler domains, and more slices of pizza per team member; but where does all that complexity go? 🧐
Our networks and infrastructure must mature and adapt to support our new distributed architecture. As we race to adopt containers, schedulers, and service meshes; we must remember to measure, monitor, and alert on our new problem domain.</description>

      <description>“Monorepo or not” is one of the biggest dev community debates for a long time. Polyrepo always works, but it can never get better. Monorepo on the other hand can be either terrible or great depending on how you implement it. Google, Facebook, Twitter store all their code in a single version control system repository. Surely if these high scale companies use a monorepo should all other companies
When i first Joined ZipRecruiter and learned that the company uses a monorepo, i thought “Wow thats weird, probably a legacy policy we can&amp;rsquo;t get away from.</description>

      <description>When we first started to use a monorepo for our serverless application, one of the first things we needed to figure out was how to reproducibly deploy changes from any commit made to the master branch. Many of the existing solutions for managing monorepos take an “all-or-nothing” approach to deploying changes, meaning that all resources within a given repository are deployed, regardless of whether or not the resource itself has changed.</description>

      <description>Can big, complex, old enterprise products move faster or is DevOps a start-up club? This is the story of our journey, a tale of how we changed the way we develop, deploy and test software in order to achieve a more reliable, traceable, consistent and faster development pipeline. All done while hundreds of developers were actively developing on the product and clearly didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be disturbed. I can say it had its moments, treats and fearless heroes, as every good story does, but the result was a reduction of more than 90% in both effort and waiting time.</description>

      <description>Engineers usually find single points of failure to be an unacceptable risk. Yet when delivering technological capabilities at large enterprises we too often fall into the trap of only one or two people know exactly what a process is that everyone is expected to follow. This leads to failure where critical operational and security concerns are missed. By documenting the governance expectations, detection and preventative controls can be created. This also presents the opportunity to leverage approaches like auto remediation and a pre-approved libraries of templates.</description>

      <description>When healthcare.gov came out, it seemed like everything went wrong, but a few months later, people were getting healthcare, and the site continued to improve over time. A big part of the change was introducing the culture of DevOps into the government agency and contractors behind that website.
While there was some initial resistance, there was also real, lasting change for the better. In this talk, you&amp;rsquo;ll hear about how the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services started to embrace DevOps and you&amp;rsquo;ll learn some principles of cultural change that you can apply to your own organization.</description>

      <description>OutSystems set out on a journey to Continuous Delivery, dramatically changing the development processes, delivery, and quality, while at the same time, continuing to develop and deliver new product features.
A few years ago, OutSystems had an annual release cadence. The once-a-year release was blocking us from having customer feedback in the loop as early as we should and our lead time was huge.
Customers want value as fast as possible, and their feedback is of the utmost importance.</description>

I enjoy the opportunity to learn new things every day, but I&amp;rsquo;m also amused by how much of what I learned when I started in the field, including working on interfaces to RDBMS at my first two jobs, is still relevant to my day to day work.</description>

      <guid>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2021-minneapolis/program/dan-woods/</guid>
      <description>Organizations today are faced with a growing dilemma when considering whether to go all in on a single cloud or run their workload across multiple clouds. Whether the reasoning is for resiliency, to leverage the best technologies, or simply to avoid vendor lock-in, practically implementing a multi-cloud strategy requires careful consideration. Most organizations cannot reasonably execute on multi-cloud because they lack cohesive CI/CD. Others lack comprehensive data movement, which limits where workloads can reasonably run.</description>

      <description>Errors can be a source of stress in our professional lives. More often than not its discovery can cause us to drop what we&amp;rsquo;re doing to investigate. As an Ops person, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to accept errors as fact of life, and even come to appreciate them. Knowing your errors can help you pinpoint the source of the problem quickly. Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled a large list of helpful (and not helpful) error messages.</description>

      <title>My Quest for Business Agility – the good bad and ugly of lean agile and DevOps transformations</title>
      <link>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2020-houston/program/michael-nir/</link>

      <guid>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2020-houston/program/michael-nir/</guid>
      <description>Why do lean agile transformations fail more often than succeed?
 Teams argue about user stories, pointing systems and tickets. Mangers measure and compare teams based on velocity. Scrum masters going through the motions chasing the South Star. No one is validating customer hypothesis for fast feedback.  In the turning point of the software digital age where organizations face a Cambrian extinction - the scientific application of agile, lean, design thinking, lean start up, lean UX, OKRs and DevOps together with high performing teams is crucial to business survival.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes container orchestration meets a modern microservice architecture: excitement! Plus, increasing needs related to traffic management, observability, access control, and the like. The CNCF Service Mesh Interface community has defined a specification for standard service mesh APIs to ensure plugins work on many meshes and allow for choice of mesh provider. Microsoft has launched a new open source project, Open Service Mesh (OSM), which is a lightweight and extensible Envoy-based service mesh that implements the SMI APIs and runs on Kubernetes.</description>

      <description>By the end of my talk, I want everyone to know what to expect when going into the initial conversations about a new job, how to approach the conversation around your target salary and what else you could and should be asking for in that conversation – like a signing bonus or a more senior title.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of money floating around in the tech industry and employees are disadvantaged in a negotiation, since we don&amp;rsquo;t know what they have to offer you. I want to make the negotiation process in tech less of a mystery, so that everyone goes in prepared for the compensation talk.
By the end of my talk, the audience should know:
 What to ask for. How to ask for it.</description>

      <description>To say it with Mark Twain: All happy DevOps adoptions are alike; each unhappy DevOps adoption is unhappy in its own way.
In this talk I want to explore the new barriers of DevOps adoption. Gone are the days that DevOps is a new concept and lack of knowledge, skills or tools is the main blocker for adoption.
Yet we don’t find many organisations who truly believe they have reached a mature state of DevOps.</description>

      <description>Nik Knight is not entirely sure how, as an English Lit and Philosophy graduate, she ended up in tech. However, having served time on first-line support, led multi-discipline Delivery Teams, and spent most of the past 20 years wrangling software releases into Production, she&amp;rsquo;s here to stay.
A firm believer that technology is all about solving “people” problems, she has a keen enthusiasm for DevOps culture and mindset. She also holds an EMCC Foundation Award in Coaching, and likes nothing more than bringing these two strands together to help teams achieve more than they think is possible.</description>

      <description>For many DevOps teams, their CI server has become just like the young shepherd-boy in the famous Aesop fable where he would cry wolf to falsely alarm the village to save their sheep. When the build is broken due to flaky automated tests, the team loses faith in the tests. How do we build the trust?

      <description>This is a personal story. It does not claim to be rooted in statistical analysis or scientific rigour, and the evidence presented is anecdotal. But it might be insightful to anyone joining, leaving, or interacting with a remote team.
From 2011 to 2017, I ran a company that had no office. Everyone worked from home, and apart from an annual one-week face to face meeting, all our communications were remote. In 2017, I sold my company and integrated my team into a company that had previously been working exclusively out of a single office.</description>

      <description>We won&amp;rsquo;t talk about differences between microservices in distributed systems nor CPU architectures, approaches to coding or frameworks. We want to talk about the diversity among the most essential &amp;ldquo;ingredient&amp;rdquo; of coding. We want to talk about us, software engineers.
When hearing about &amp;ldquo;diversity in IT&amp;rdquo; some of us smile, while others frown. It might be something we expect from the company or we might perceive it as unnecessary actions aimed at imagined and nonexistent problems.</description>

      <description>Most of the IT projects fails not due to technical problems but because people find it hard to talk to each other, communicate their needs, share their ideas and worries. This is especially important in the IT world that is based on creativity and constant learning. Research shows that successful Teams are not successful because they are technically more advanced, but they are able to communicate openly. We may deny that psychology is as important as our technical and professional skills, as I was doing a few years ago, but actually they way we adjust our communication to the peers is even more important than the work we do.</description>

Contaremos como adotamos o Docker e saímos de um processo puramente manual e enfadonho para um mais automatizado e também de que forma estamos planejando reorganizar o nosso processo de integração contínua para poder automatizar mais o nosso trabalho.

      <description>There are reportedly more daily CICS transactions than the 3.5 billion Google searches a day. Additional research shows that there are over 200 billion lines of active COBOL code. Companies are deeply embedded in a long history of mainframe applications across many types of mainframe languages. Yet the current trend is to move mainframes into “maintain” mode and instead to move forward with sparkly new tech. This approach of a “two-speed IT” has cultural impacts across the organization, such as decreased engagement, and an aging workforce depleting faster than new applications can be implemented.</description>

      <description>No novo arranjo de entrega, a visão tradicional se desmancha para surgir um novo paradigma de organização. Como podemos transitar para o DevOps?, quais alternativas temos? como migramos sem parar a organização. Discutiremos alternativas visando opções evolutivas.
Os processos tradicionais nos deixam presos à execução de trabalho manual, orientado à documentação, burocrático e focado em atividades isoladas de super-especialistas, um esquema que não funciona na entrega de valor à organização. Como migramos dos conflitos onde sempre vimos a Agilidade e a Estabilidade como eternos enemigos.</description>

A perda ou o vazamento dessas informações podem gerar danos irreparáveis a empresa.

      <description>A ideia dessa palestra é trazer para a discussão uma nova visão do mundo DevOps. Muito se falou da perda de funções com a chegada do DevOps e a palestra é justamente para mostrar a mudança de pensamento e ideologia que o QA tem que tomar com a chegada do DevOps, sair do tradicional e começar a se adaptar a essa nova fase. A proposta é falar da evolução que um profissional de Teste de Software sofreu durante os últimos 10 anos e mostrar que essa evolução ainda permanece contante, principalmente com a mudança de cultura das empresas com a chegada do DevOps.</description>

 O nascimento do Guia Foca; A estrutura de documentação; Processo de validação/teste; Processo de geração dos pacotes com cada versão do Guia (Iniciante, Intermediário e Avançado); Processo de deploy do Guia Foca nos websites.</description>

      <description>Here’s the Live Action OAuth Theater segment of the talk (5 minutes): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYzf2JBdUM8
If you’ve ever tried to search for information on OAuth and/or OpenID Connect, you’ve probably encountered deep dive code examples or references to the specifications. The specifications are great if you’re building OAuth from scratch or suffer from insomnia. Many examples focus on just code, rather than concepts.
These types of resources are not useful for understanding the concepts and historical backdrop for why OAuth and OIDC exist.</description>

      <description>Everyone talks about the fact that infrastructure should be programmatic and treated as a code, but often what this means is just writing a bunch of scripts to automate our deployments. By doing so, aspects like proper documentation, separation to modules , abstraction, even version control that are standard for &amp;ldquo;regular&amp;rdquo; software projects are omitted from infrastructure systems. This leads to cumbersome, monolith system - the very thing we are trying to resolve in the software design.</description>

      <description>Ambientes heterogêneos pode ser considerado um dos maiores desafios de criação, desenvolvimento e implantação de produtos de software. Dado esse contexto, a comunidade DevOps traz uma habilidade cultural que tenta minimizar os impactos desse desafio: a Observabilidade. Conceito recente que se utiliza de contextos e ferramentas já presente há bastante tempo no desenvolvimento de software, a observabilidade tem o intuito de entender os estados/comportamentos das nossas aplicações através das suas saídas.</description>

      <description>Observability, the trade of observing systems and making sense out of the operational jungle. With the focus on reliability of platforms, everybody is rushing into observability, but are they attacking the subject from the right angle?
Many blog posts and conference talks always highlight the fact that it is not about the tools but what does that mean really in day to day.
How do companies implement it?
What does an observability team does?</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of talk about software ownership—but what does &amp;ldquo;owning code in production&amp;rdquo; really mean for developers, day to day? Many development teams still reach for logs in production as the most familiar way to bridge the development environment with production.
This talk will make the case that observability—and the skills to craft the right graphs and read them—benefits developers more than it does operators by examining several instances where well-informed devs can supercharge their development process:</description>

      <description>Distributed systems, microservices, containers and schedulers, polyglot persistence .. modern infrastructure patterns are fluid and dynamic, chaotic and transient. So why are we still using LAMP-stack era tools to debug and monitor them? We&amp;rsquo;ll cover some of the many shortcomings of traditional metrics and logs (and APM tools backed by metrics or logs), and show how complexity is their kryptonite.
So how do we handle the coming complexity Armageddon? It starts with a more modern approaches to observability, such as client-side structured data and event-driven debugging, distributed tracing, and more; no matter how many tags you add to a metric store, it still can&amp;rsquo;t tell a story like events can.</description>

      <description>You know the drill: DevOps is using tool(s) X. So obviously, observability can be solved by throwing some tools together as well; generally logs, metrics, and traces often called the trifecta of observability.
But observability is not a tool — it is a property of a system. Moving from many small blackboxes to a more holistic view of your system. It includes tools, but not exactly three distinct features (especially if your solution happens to support those).</description>

      <description>In DevOps, especially on the Ops side of the house, it seems you can&amp;rsquo;t outrun this Observability term, but what is it? Monitoring with a new name? A marketing gimmick for new infrastructure tools? Something about dynamic linear systems? And why should I care? And if I do care, how do I get started?
This 5 minute talk will introduce what Observability is, convince you to care, and give you some starting points and guidelines to think about as you get started with a slide reserved for &amp;ldquo;where to go from here&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>The complexity of the systems we are responsible for has grown significantly over the last decade. High performing teams use monitoring and observability to increase the reliability of these systems. Come along one practitioner&amp;rsquo;s journey and let his observations guide the way you think about, and change, observability practices in your company.
This talk starts with my early experience on a team struggling with monitoring our new fangled cloud. That experience inspired me to become part of the industry designing and developing the next-generation of monitoring systems.</description>

      <description>I’m coding since 4th grade when my dad taught me BASIC, and I got hooked. From that point, I learned to code in many programming languages (today my favorite is C#). Today I’m working at Soluto by Asurion, and coding is a huge part of my day job. My passion for AppSec started by accident when I was offered the role of security champion. The AppSec journey was (and still is) fascinated, and taught me a lot.</description>

      <description>The always-on, always-available expectations of digital services have increased the requirements of technical teams to provide response and readiness around the clock. For teams new to this concept, introducing on-call can be challenging. There are technical and cultural considerations to keep in mind when adding on-call responsibilities to new teams. In this talk, we’ll look at some of those challenges and provide recommendations for folks who are dreading their new duties.</description>

      <description>(Hey! Listen!) The first Zelda game (1987) set you off on your own after only 7 words and less than a minute of play. As game companies recognized how onboarding is crucial to retention and experience, they continuously iterated on the structures and durations. Future introductions ranged from 17 minutes to almost 3 hours and added travel companions to help guide you on your journey, such as Navi or Midna. Whether your company is just getting started or is already established, there’s valuable lessons we can glean from their implementations.</description>

      <description>Gottfried Leibniz believed the only two numbers humans needed were one and zero. He refined the binary number system and paved the way for the machines we work on every day. For ages, one was the only number humans had. And it wasn’t until the concept of zero – a placeholder more than a number – was invented that humans made massive jumps in mathematical thinking. But perhaps one and zero have more to teach us than the bits in our machines.</description>

      <description>TALK ABSTRACT Life is not easy. But it is up to us to build resilience that enables us to move forward in a graceful way. Attending to difficult feelings without becoming subsumed by them; we can develop an awareness of our bigger picture goals and accomplish tasks we never thought were possible.
We’ve been conditioned over the years to always question whether we can succeed. We tend to focus on all the things that could go wrong instead of the possibilities.</description>

      <description>To say it with Mark Twain: All happy DevOps adoptions are alike; each unhappy DevOps adoption is unhappy in its own way. In this talk I want to explore the new barriers of DevOps adoption. Gone are the days that DevOps is a new concept and lack of knowledge, skills or tools is the main blocker for adoption. Yet we don’t find many organisations who truly believe they have reached a mature state of DevOps.</description>

      <description>Nowadays every application exposes their metrics via an HTTP endpoint readable by using Prometheus. Recently the exposition format got included into the OpenMetrics standard of the CNCF. But why a standardization process was needed and is good? And what are the novelties and differences OpenMetrics introduces? What it will gives us more? This lightning talk will answer those questions while presenting the upcoming OpenMetrics official standard.</description>

      <description>Why is container security important? We will review 3 tools that help will full coverage security from build to live protection so you can have full system coverage with automation notes on integrating with your CI/CD pipelines.
Anchore, scan your container after it&amp;rsquo;s build and prevent an unsecure build from pushing up to your repository.
Falco, preventing any image that doesn&amp;rsquo;t pass the anchore policies from deploying into your environment.</description>

Mean Time Between Fallout by Aaron Aldrich&amp;nbsp; from &amp;nbsp;DevOpsDays Houston    DevOps trends are clear on measuring systems Mean Time To Recovery rather than Mean Time Between Failures. I argue that worrying about time between failures actually causes more harm than worrying about recovery.</description>

      <title>Operating within Normal Parameters: Monitoring Kubernetes</title>
      <link>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2020-seattle/program/elana-hashman/</link>

      <guid>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2020-seattle/program/elana-hashman/</guid>
      <description>After Kubernetes takes over your data centers, how can you be sure that it&amp;rsquo;s operating within normal parameters? What does &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; even mean? By formalizing your expected quality of service, you can measure and compare against known targets with open source tools like Prometheus. In this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll use Kubernetes as a case study for introducing service level objectives (SLOs) to guide monitoring efforts. Come learn the how and why of metric selection for monitoring Kubernetes quality of service, what gaps exist in the open source Kubernetes monitoring ecosystem, how to use Prometheus and its exporters to establish predictability and &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; baselines, and how to use this telemetry to debug service degradations in a Kubernetes cluster.</description>

If I have a CI/CD pipeline, I am “doing DevOps”, right? Not exactly. The dilemma that these executives have is that they don’t believe DevOps can be with the people they have.</description>

      <description>Our job as engineers does not stop with eliminating technical defects and ensuring high reliability. Engineers of all kinds must ensure their work serves the public good. A service that reliably harms, exacerbates injustices, or excludes marginalized groups is not a service worth building and maintaining. Learn how to effectively accomplish change in your working conditions or your employer’s products through grassroots employee advocacy, from an employee advocate who has successfully lobbied their employer to change both product policies and working conditions for the better.</description>

      <description>This is an idea that came up when discussing that we need to shed the thinking that deployments don’t need to occur on a Friday. I agree they do not, and we started discussing the increased risk of coupling deployments with releases. At a very high level I want to introduce the concept of orthogonality between deployments and releases while highlighting techniques like ring deployments, feature flags, and canary releases.</description>

      <description>Felizmente no decorrer dos últimos anos tem havido uma tendência nas organizações de escrever relatórios Postmortem sobre incidentes e falhas em sistemas. Os Postmortem estão realmente encontrando a causa(s)-raiz? Há algum viés que está fazendo olhar para o evento errado?
Escrever Postmortem não é um só um ato de escrever um documento, é um processo de investigação que deve ser focado no conjunto Pessoas, Processos e Software. Como é a interação entre eles observando qual a cadeia de eventos que gerou o incidente.</description>

      <description>The map is not the territory, the power is not the work, and the product is not the experience.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look back at the water-and-belt driven factories of pre-electrical industrialization to understand how software follows patterns we can understand and anticipate. How do factories get safer, faster, better, and happier, and how can we make those perceptual changes in our own code factories? When is it the right time to consolidate, and when is it time to break out?</description>

      <description>Ignite Talk
Home automation is increasingly popular. However, the one thing that is often overlooked with current solutions is their complete lack of attention to high availability: Typically a failure of your automation hub quickly renders an elegant smart home into an ordinary dumb home.
In the pursuit of building a reliable smart home, we will investigate ways to make the open-source automation platform &amp;ldquo;home-assistant&amp;rdquo; highly available by applying Kubernetes to a not quite standard problem.</description>

      <description>When we deploy to the cloud, most of us aren&amp;rsquo;t dealing with just a single cloud provider or even deployment tool. It seems like even the simplest of deployments today needs a load balancer, SSL certificates, persistent file storage, DNS&amp;hellip; and somewhere in there is your application.
That is a lot to figure out! The Cloud Native Application Bundles specification was created to help address that problem, helping you manage everything in a single package and focus on what you know best: your application.</description>

      <description>Most network monitoring relies upon the network devices themselves providing the signal that they are healthy or unhealthy via syslog messages, SNMP, telemetry or custom APIs.
In large scale networks, we can’t trust the network devices to accurately report health in all the possible failure cases that may exist. In addition to standard monitoring tools, we also actively probe our networks with test traffic to ensure the platform is behaving as we expect.</description>

      <description>We often think of our automated testing and build pipelines as something important to our stakeholders, to assert the stability of our system. Some developers think of testing as a chore, or something that slows you down.
This short talk is a story from earlier in my career, a cautionary tale even. I then make the argument that quality gates and automated processes can be invaluable for junior engineers, as they provide the freedom to contribute without fear.</description>

      <description>TALK ABSTRACT Like most Silicon Valley engineers, I know what it’s like to put in long hours working passionately on a technical project that you genuinely believe will change the world. However, unlike most software engineers, I decided (very) early in my career to trade the massive company campuses and busy commutes (and outrageous housing costs) of the Bay Area for the wide-open plains of Dallas, where I am over a thousand miles away from my nearest teammate in Orlando, the second remote member of our three-person team.</description>

      <description>Nesta talk a ideia é demostrar um case prático onde o tempo de execução dos testes foi otimizado consideravelmente através da técnica de paralelização da execução dos testes, balanceando as specs para que o tempo seja reduzido e o resultado da execução se mantenha estável.</description>

      <description>In this workshop we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the main aspects of handling the large tech company interview process. The core of this being the System Design interview and the Coding interview.
First we&amp;rsquo;ll cover how to prep for interviews, resources, and time allocation. Along with what you should expect throughout the process.
Next we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the solutions to a few common coding interview questions, with a little theory along the way. We&amp;rsquo;ll walk through PHP code examples that solve FizzBuzz, 8 Queens, and a Quicksort implementation.</description>

He first presented concepts on Agile Infrastructure at Agile 2008 in Toronto, and in 2009 he organized the first devopsdays . Since then he has been promoting the notion of ‘devops’ to exchange ideas between these groups and show how they can help each other to achieve better results in business.</description>

      <description>PedidosYa es un emprendimiento surgido en Uruguay que se transformó en líder del mercado de compra de comida online en varios países de Latinoamérica. En los últimos años muchas decisiones, tales como incorporar delivery de supermercados o farmacias, han hecho crecer de forma exponencial el flujo de usuarios y solicitudes de la plataforma.
Partiendo hace 6 años desde una aplicación monolítica y llegando a hoy, con una plataforma distribuida en más de 30 micro-servicios, los roles de Cloud Computing y la cultura DevOps jugaron un papel determinante en el proceso.</description>

      <description>DevOps have appeared on a conflict between development and operations, and commonly it is still like this. However, if we look deeper, it is all about culture and conflicts between people in a fast changing environment which we call &amp;lsquo;agile&amp;rsquo;. How to stay calm on the road of delivering happiness to customers, to preserve good relations with colleagues still being professional and delivering the product? I will focus on several cases from my own experience which will show how to achieve the goal in cooperation with different people and their roles, from your teammate or product owner to senior management, even if you feel yourself on the opposite side.</description>

      <title>Performance Engineering in the Age of DevOps and Agile</title>

      <description>Performance engineering was fairly straightforward in traditional waterfall projects. You would performance test at the end of the project after development and all functional testing was complete. This approach simply cannot work in the age of DevOps and Agile. Release cycles happen too quickly. Code changes too much. Data preparation takes too long. Results analysis is too slow. You need new approaches. Performance engineering needs a new paradigm. And you need to rethink the role of the performance engineer.</description>

      <description>It all started as Continuous Integration: you were able to build code in an automated and predictable way (and maybe run some tests too); then Continuous Delivery, and you automated deployments.
Now is time to automate your pipeline infrastructure: why installing and configuring your agents by hand, waiting for setup to finish (through many reboots) to finally tick the workloads you need?
Come and see how to use Docker to script your agents and Terraform to setup your hosts: more power to the code!</description>

      <description>After 10 years of often heated discussion around the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; ways to &amp;ldquo;DevOps&amp;rdquo;, it seems the community is still no closer to agreeing on the best path to production. In this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the underlying problems that drive practitioners to the DevOps space and the practical business value outcomes that can be achieved using the overarching patterns and practices contained therein.
This will be a combination of examples and short demos that illustrate the different points in the software development lifecycle that commonly create bottlenecks and limit the amount business value a team can deliver to the org or company.</description>

      <description>Video games are challenging, frustrating, and (hopefully!) satisfying. So is the world of DevOps: Challenge, frustration, and satisfaction are key ingredients in high performing teams. Unlike video games, however, in DevOps we can redesign the game to improve our chances of winning.
In this talk we will:
 Play a collaborative video game. Experience challenge, frustration, and satisfaction. Learn how high performing teams change their game to take advantage of these three emotions.</description>

      <description>Is your company hiring DevOps Engineers? If so, this talk is for you, please read on!
By forming dedicated “DevOps Teams”, management is trying to create an illusion that their company is being DevOps-enabled and modern. But, this approach is so wrong and it doesn’t bring us anywhere closer to what DevOps practices are preaching. Moreover, this creates new silos - totally opposed to what we should be doing! Instead, we need to roll up our sleeves and start focusing on making a cultural shift, so that our every engineer truly understands the benefits of DevOps.</description>

      <description>Softwares robustos se apoiam em frameworks e bibliotecas livres para otimizar a implementação do sistema. Embora essa prática permita incorporar funcionalidades, junto também pode ser integrado vulnerabilidades no sistema. Mas não precisa parar tudo agora, há formas automatizadas de se proteger.
Essa conversa trará um pouco do porque se preocupar com isso, como podemos verificar essas vulnerabilidades de forma automatizadas e propostas de como o que podemos fazer para minimizar o impacto na segurança da sua aplicação.</description>

      <description>Todo sistema está sujeito à falhas, desde pequenos aumentos de latência até downtimes catastróficos, exposição de dados e prejuízos à imagem e a empresa como um todo. O que qualquer uma dessas falhas, independente da gravidade, têm em comum? Todas têm muito a ensinar e podem te ajudar a construir um sistema mais robusto e confiável, que é o sonho de todo engenheiro de software! Para isso existem processos como os de post-mortem, amplamente usados no Nubank e outras grandes empresas, que permitem verdadeiramente dissecar um incidente tentando extrair o máximo de informações, ajudando a guiar melhorias e backlogs.</description>

      <description>For more than two years running PostgreSQL with Patroni on AWS has served us very well: Scaling with the number of teams, full control over our PostgreSQL deployment and flexibility in the hardware selection including AWS i3 instances made it successful. With the end of 2016 we started to target our next generation infrastructure running on Kubernetes, diving into how to efficiently operate PostgreSQL on Kubernetes and increase user happiness by better integrating into the Zalando tech platform and providing PostgreSQL as a Service.</description>

      <description>Como você monitora o Postgres? Que informações você pode obter e em que grau elas ajudam a solucionar problemas operacionais? E se você quiser/precisar registrar todas as consultas? Isso pode derrubar um bancos de dados de tráfego pesado. Na OnGres somos obcecados em melhorar a observabilidade do Postgres, por isso trabalhamos junto com o pessoal da Tetrate desenvolvendo uma extensão de Filtro de Rede do Envoy para Postgres, que estende a observabilidade do tráfego.</description>

      <description>GitLab.com’s monolithic Rails application experiences high week-on-week traffic growth. To ensure availability, GitLab’s Infrastructure team track and plan ahead in order to avoid hitting capacity limits in the application, whether these limits be CPU, database connection pools, memory, storage or any number of other finite resources. Hitting these limits could result in hours, or days, of degraded service while workarounds are put in place.
With this in mind, the team set about building a set of tools on top of Prometheus recording rules and alerts to provide them with the information they need to be sufficiently forewarned, up to a month in advance, of potential resource saturation issues.</description>

      <description>Production is down, again, and The Lone Engineer worked all day and night to save the business! Overtime so routine that&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s no longer &amp;ldquo;over&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;expected&amp;rdquo;. We create these scenarios by supporting strenuous environments and rewarding Save the Day behaviors. So let&amp;rsquo;s discuss how to change that.
Reactive work is a massive time and value sink, but unfortunately existing gaps in team structure and/or metrics don&amp;rsquo;t capture &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s missing&amp;rdquo;. For example, how do you track calls not placed, outages that never occurred?</description>

      <description>Detective controls and preventative controls are concepts we use a lot with our client. We advocate for “Freedom within Boundaries” for develoeprs; at the end of the day, we want devs to go fast, yet organizations are still secure and protected. The boundaries are been configured by two sets of things. A pipeline driven, aka preventative control framework for all below the line fundamental resources, as well as cloud native tools plus OSS tools to prevent any out of boundary actions.</description>

      <description>How can we make our tools work with our team? Like a good team member, great tools keep us informed, implement our decisions, and help us understand errors. Drawing from aviation, medicine, and software, here are strategies for choosing and building tools that enhance us and do not frustrate us.
Great automation doesn’t replace humans; it enhances us. When we are choosing or building tools for our team, we want them to play like team members: keep us informed, make the easy decisions repeatably, and pass the hard decisions to the humans along with the information we need to make them.</description>

      <description>How do I prioritize spending limited cycles on unlimited potential problems?
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a technique stolen from “real world” reliability engineering that allows us to create objectivity within a subjective domain.
By brainstorming a list of all the failure modes of a system and then subjectively ranking and quantifying them, we can generate a relative priority for each case, allowing for clear agreement between teams on which cases (if any) warrant action or automation.</description>

      <description>Managing risk needs to scale as your product grows in popularity and complexity. In traditional software development, often security was treated as a last gating factor at best and post-incident concern at worst. How do we shift our security processes left - in other words, earlier in the development lifecycle? The cost of applying security practices too late can be catastrophic to a company, leading to the loss of customer trust and affecting the bottom line.</description>

      <description>The feedback loop is one of the most important parts of programming. We write tests and try to mitigate all possible problems, but until we deploy our code, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell what &amp;ldquo;works&amp;rdquo; and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t. In this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss methods used to ensure everything works the way it should before deploying to production.</description>

      <description>The good, bad and ugly of how Sendgrid is incorporating Product Management practices into planning and execution within their DevOps and Platform teams to cut off scope creep, never ending projects and realizing value for internal teams.
Dev Ops and Platform teams have too many projects, not enough time and users who are an email, message or quick walk away to tap you on the shoulder to ask if that thing is done because it is really holding them up from completing something for real this time.</description>

      <description>So you’re trying to move from agile project teams to business-aligned product teams. Everyone from the CEO to middle management is on board. Yet somehow it’s not that easy, is it? You’ve just about figured out how to split infrastructure responsibilities between teams when the next great tech for cost-effective scalability is out there and it doesn’t fit in the new model. Oh, and let’s not forget that products X and Y have no automated tests since they were developed by temporary project teams.</description>

      <description>How do we progress from testing in prod to experimentation in prod?
Progressive delivery is a transformative cultural shift that holds great appeal to the enterprise, for whom any notion of continuous implied a loss of control that was far too scary. Yet, testing in prod, be it via feature flags, chaos engineering, or canary rollouts, makes assumptions that would invalidate any field experiment:
1 - That any team forming a hypothesis for a test possesses a sophisticated amount of knowledge and control over their systems, ie: what they are, and how they run, how to change them, and how they might break.</description>

This year for the first half of open space time we&#39;ll be hosting a park bench panel. Listen in and participate in an engaging panel discussion! A Park Bench Panel consists of a panel with at least one open seat, available to anyone in the audience. When someone claims the empty seat, the conversation is paused until another panelist leaves, ensuring one seat is always available for new perspectives.</description>

      <description>My life is a hilarious roller coaster of miss-intended programming bugs because at 4 foot tall and 65 kilograms I completely fall off your radar.
Why did my scale call me! Why does facial recognition see me as a child? These are all valid questions I often ask myself as I navigate my weird and different world. Have you heard the phrase “You have to be this tall for Micro-services”? well what about: “You have to be this tall to operate a mobile phone?</description>

      <description>In this talk, Dan will explain five key lessons to keep in mind when enabling progressive delivery of your applications.
Cloud native and serverless architectures make deployment easy - just git push or run a kubectl command and you’re done. But at scale, you need to have confidence in every release before it hits your users
Enter progressive delivery, a set of techniques that allow you to balance the benefits of continuous delivery with the operational best practices that your operations team loves and your users deserve.</description>

      <title>Prometheus as exposition format for eBPF programs on Kubernetes clusters</title>
      <link>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-istanbul/program/leonardo-di-donato/</link>

      <guid>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-istanbul/program/leonardo-di-donato/</guid>
      <description>Open Source Software Engineer @InfluxData
Nowadays every application exposes their metrics via an HTTP endpoint readable by using Prometheus. Recently the exposition format got included into the OpenMetrics standard of the CNCF. Nevertheless, this very common pattern by definition only expose metrics regarding the specific applications being observed.
This talk wants to expose the idea, and a reference implementation, of a slightly different use case that uses eBPF programs as a source of information to allow the exposition and collection of kernel and application probes via a Prometheus endpoint.</description>

      <description>In this talk I will discuss the trials and tribulations of running Prometheus in production. Based on my learnings of running Prometheus in production I will use a series of live demos within Kubernetes to illustrate the limitations of Prometheus and how to work around them using the Thanos project!</description>

      <description>Lightning Talk
Many of us will use a tool or location or object without ever having heard it spoken aloud. While some try to retroactively define the correct pronunciation, it seems that the Kubernetes community leans into the ambiguity. Today, I provide the definitive guide to pronuncing ‘kubectl&#39;.</description>

      <description>There is a strong competition on Continuous Integration tools which may complicate development teams to decide which tool to use. At the begining of last year I started evaluating them in articles, publishing installers, and giving talks about my findings.
This session will compare, among others, the following CI tools for web development:
 CircleCI Travis CI GitLab CI GitHub Actions  </description>

      <description>Interesting in speaking at a conference or meet-up, but don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start? Have a great idea for a talk but your proposals keep getting rejected? Or maybe your talk has been accepted but you&amp;rsquo;re nervous about being on stage?
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry—we&amp;rsquo;ll get you sorted.
In this workshop, we&amp;rsquo;ll work through things like idea generation, the CFP process, the art of the slide, stage presence, and more. Attendees can come with material they&amp;rsquo;d like help with, but people who are totally new to the game are more than welcome too!</description>

      <description>Métricas, métricas e mais métricas. As métricas se tornam cada vez mais importantes em um mundo agil ou devops. Mas na maior parte das vezes estamos falando de métricas de quantos disso ou qual a velocidade daquilo outro. Nesta apresentação, vamos falar de um conceito de métricas diferente. As métricas disponibilizadas pela ferramenta SonarQube de analise de código. Venha conhecer um pouco quais são essas métricas, como elas são medidas e como elas podem ajudar seu time, ao estarem integradas em uma esteira DevOps e veja sua qualidade crescer de forma embutida no processo.</description>

      <title>Quando A Cultura DevOps Transcende A Tecnologia!</title>

      <description>Em 2001, o manifesto ágil surgiu com o objetivo de desenvolver softwares com menos desperdícios, mais qualidade, mais interação e com foco na entrega para o cliente. Mas com o passar dos anos, agilistas começaram a observar que precisavam melhorar toda a cadeia de valor (fluxos de desenvolvimento de produto de produtos e serviços). Para suprir essa necessidade, em 2008 surgiu a Cultura DevOps. A Cultura DevOps veio para melhorar a comunicação, a automação e a colaboração entre os fluxos, diminuindo gaps e evoluindo o desenvolvimento, a infraestrutura e a qualidade em todo o processo.</description>

      <description>Quantum computing is arriving. With quantum computers we can tackle problems in entirely new ways leveraging entanglement, superposition, and interference. Scenario simulations, optimization, AI/ML patterns, and physical processes are areas where quantum computing may show earliest impact.
In this session we&amp;rsquo;ll cover what is quantum computing, why it is so different and important, resources available to developers, and how to get started with access to real quantum systems.</description>

Los programas, monolitos o sistemas distribuidos son complejos porque los construyen personas. Esta realidad, que a veces se obvia, es más asequible cuando se analiza desde una visión de las relaciones humanas que típicamente ha quedado fuera del rol masculino socialmente aceptado. En el contexto de un gremio altamente masculinizado, esta charla revisa los roles de género y cómo pueden ayudar o dificultar la implementación de una cultura DevOps que lleve nuestros proyectos a la tan deseada excelencia técnica.</description>

      <description>What is time? Is it fixed or fluid; physical or philosophical; quantifiable, or completely questionable? These deep questions may never be answered, but one thing is clear: the measuring, recording, and interpretation of time is a fundamentally important mission for humanity. In the modern age of computing, the accurate reckoning of time across cities, countries, and even planets is performed by a fantastic patchwork of actors—from governments and corporations, to academicians and hackers of all colours.</description>

      <description>Many DevOps devotees have heard about security and maybe even read a few blog posts about DevSecOps. But you get busy building code, reducing WIP, and eliminating tech debt. That doesn’t leave a lot of time to make sure the code you are actually deploying is secure. But the power of DevOps is that you can build security in once, and it’s there. And even better, you don’t have to be a security expert to be able to start deploying more secure code.</description>

      <description>DevOps practitioners must get feedback from quality assurance and security testing as early in the development pipeline as possible. When continuously building and deploying web application projects, being able to run a test and get output on it within minutes is a super power skill that gets teams ahead of potential problems. In this workshop, be prepared to use Docker to run multiple tests on your websites, learn about what the different tests are used for, and then become familiar with the output to interpret them for actionable feedback.</description>

      <description>The reactive manifesto is meant to guide you in building Responsive, Resilient, Elastic (scalable), and Message Driven systems.
But these are all bombastic words which are quite meaningless without a good context or good examples.
This talk will walk you through a story of improving a real life service, bringing it to perform well, and link the steps to the reactive manifesto cornerstones.</description>

      <description>“Why did we decide this?” – every developer in history, 12 months after making a decision.
As technologists, we make architectural decisions all of the time. What we’re not good at doing is:
 Socializing these decisions though the team/department (whoever participated in the discussion has the context, everyone else is out of luck!) Recording the decisions, and more importantly, the context behind the decisions, in a way that our future selves (or anyone – someone just joining the team, for example) can look back and understand why the decision was made and what the factors that went into the decision were.</description>

Registration for DevOpsDays Stockholm is now open. As this is now a virtual event we don&amp;rsquo;t plan to charge anything for attending. We&amp;rsquo;d still like you to register though so we&amp;rsquo;ll have some idea about how many wants to join.
You can also register directly on tito at here if you don&amp;rsquo;t wish to use the embedded version.</description>

      <description>The days of trying to prevent failures are gone. In today’s high-volume, cloud-based systems, anything that can go wrong will eventually go wrong. It is far better to spend our time engineering fault tolerance than pursuing the impossible goal of fault prevention. Not only is reliability engineering one of the highest paying jobs in software engineering today, it is also a job full of unique challenges that demand creative thinking and problem solving.</description>

      <description>The expression “separate the signal from the noise” comes up early and often in monitoring, but when our systems continue to get louder and louder – more errors, more alerts, more logs to sift through – finding the one anomaly that actually matters to the reliability of your application can be like finding a needle in a stack of needles.
This was a problem my team encountered when monitoring our own systems.</description>

      <description>Traveling with multiple electronic devices can be a chore, especially with constraints on size and the hurdles of security. We can try to solve this problem by using a remote desktop accessible from any of our devices but that can take time to set up! What happens when we need another remote desktop quickly? How can we create a remote desktop as on-demand as a container or virtual machine in our datacenter?</description>

I started dabbling with computers in the late 80s with a ZX Spectrum clone. It was love at the first command line and having control over my computing units has always been a must for me. My first contact with Linux happened when I was in Math school, in the late 90s, and it&amp;rsquo;s been almost 20 years since I last had a computer running something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t *nix based.</description>

      <description>I started using computers in the late 80s, and have always been fascinated by how they work and how to manage them. I have an innate curiosity to try new systems and love automating things, from large scale mail servers to something as trivial as my own home - I didn&amp;rsquo;t choose DevOps as a career, it was a natural path for someone like me.
I am obsessed with verbose debug logs, having a trustworthy terminal window always open and - of course - cats :)</description>

      <description>Resilience engineering is one of those things we all want to do, but never quite find the time to practice. There are always fires to put out and new infrastructure to deploy.
This talk will cover the fundamentals required for applying resilience engineering principles in your day to day work. It will cover how to identify the system dependencies that affect component and system-level service quality, and then go over some of the mitigation strategies that you can employ to prevent and alleviate failures in your own environment, starting from the simplest and cheapest, and then increasing in terms time, cost, and knowledge requirements.</description>

      <description>Resilience Engineering (RE) is both multidisciplinary field of study as well as a community of practitioner-researchers from multiple high-tempo, high-consequence domains such as aviation, medicine, power distribution, space operations, and critical infrastructure. In recent years, the world of software engineering and operations has become involved and more acquainted with this almost 20 year-old field and community. This talk will give a &amp;ldquo;lay of the land&amp;rdquo; on what RE is, what it is not, what efforts are relevant to the DevOps community, what attendees can do to learn more.</description>

      <description>How do you ensure that your newly deserved service is stable, reliable, and maintainable, prior to rolling to production? What about services that are already in production? Are there ways you and your team could prevent major outages in advance of critical outages and late-night pagers? Well-defined and calmly enforced standards can prevent and fix both major and minor outages. The enforcement of preventative measures go back through numerous concepts and industries, preventing countless major incidents.</description>

      <title>Retros are the New Black: How to Cultivate Continuous Improvement Across Teams</title>

      <description>Raw engineering talent is important to achieve business and product needs; however, it is also important to make space to improvement team dynamics in order to maximize the effectiveness of individuals and maintain emotionally healthy working environments. One tactic to achieve this is to organize team retros on a regular cadence.
Retros, when executed properly, empower individuals to give and receive blameless honest feedback. Done wrong or not at all, resentment can build and lead to a toxic engineering culture.</description>

      <description>Seattle has two of the longest floating bridges in the world, and in 1990, one of them sank while it was being repurposed. This accident was a classic complex systems failure with a massive PR problem and great documentation. That combination is an excellent frame for talking about incident retrospectives- the good, the bad, the vaguely confusing and unsatisfying. Come for the interesting disaster story, stay to learn about the language of blame and how to ask warm, thoughtful engineering questions.</description>

      <description>CTO de NetLabs, administrador de sistemas Linux, geek, implementador de tecnologías divertidas. Me gustan los proyectos distintos y desafiantes, donde haya que jugar con tecnologías nuevas o tomar enfoques no tan convencionales. Cuando algo pasa a ser mainstream, es hora de buscar la próxima tecnología a implementar! Mi fuerte está en poder entender cómo funcionan las cosas, y en no tener miedo a desarmarlas para poder arreglarlas o mejorarlas. Tal vez sea por eso que tengo un taller de tornería mecánica en el garage…</description>

The show follows the adventures of a brilliant Senior Principal engineer and his Junior mentoree, as they face interesting challenges, not too far from the ones we encounter in our day to day work.</description>

      <description>Nos últimos 10 anos temos visto cada vez mais empresas confirmarem os benefícios do movimento DevOps. Integração/Entrega contínua (CI/CD), arquitetura microserviços, testes automatizados, Cloud e Infraestrutura como código são práticas e tecnologias que realmente funcionam e estão presentes em empresas bem posicionadas no mercado. Entretanto, é conhecido que adotar tais práticas e tecnologias em ambientes com legado é um enorme desafio.
Apesar disso, engenheiros DevOps têm concentrado esforços na adaptação e desenvolvimento de técnicas, ferramentas e práticas que auxiliem organizações que possuem legado em suas jornadas de transformação.</description>

      <description>Conway’s Law says that “Organizations which design systems, are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations”. The communication structures are heavily influenced by how the teams are structured and whether they can create a culture of shared responsibility.
In this presentation, Adarsh Shah will talk about various team structures and how DevOps culture prospers in those structures. He will explain when and why these team structures can be beneficial and what are the various paths that he have seen organizations take during the DevOps transformation journey from Dev &amp;amp; Ops silo to one of these team structures &amp;amp; their pros &amp;amp; cons.</description>

      <description>When we’re responsible for production, it can be hard to find room to learn. That’s why I run my own email server. It’s still “production” — if it stays down, that’s pretty bad — but I own all the decisions, take more risks, and have learned lots. And so can you! Come see why and how to get started.
With one command, install famously secure email software. A couple more and it’s running.</description>

      <description>In a distributed cloud world, we are frequently talking about how to scale our systems so that they are reliable, resilient, and fault-tolerant. But these concepts don’t just apply to the computational aspect. A somewhat unconventional experiment of trying to work for a month without using StackOverflow showed that we can actually reuse the concepts we are already familiar with and apply them to the way we share knowledge within our teams.</description>

      <title>Scrumming Solo: No Scrum Master or Product Owner</title>
      <link>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-vancouver/program/jessie-ye/</link>

      <description>Incorporating Scrum practices in DevOps teams presents several issues: the nature of our work is much more interrupt-driven; our work can often be full of unknowns; and a dedicated Product Owner / SME on all things DevOps is hard to come by. Even in the presence of a Scrum Master, the task of organizing and running sprints becomes seemingly impossible. But do not despair! The fight is far from over. Like any organization adopting Scrum, you can Scrum with a healthy dose of patience, and willingness to experiment.</description>

      <description>Há um consenso de que DevOps é uma cultura e não ferramentas A, B e/ou C. Se é uma cultura, por que dizemos e não explicamos quais sãos as formas de aplicá-la nas organizações? Esta apresentação é uma proposta de como aplicar a tal “Cultura DevOps”
A mudança da cultura organizacional não tem uma dinâmica linear, ela tem diversas contradições, movimentos progressivos e retrógrados. A “Cultura DevOps” está relacionada ao aumento da experimentação, falha e aprendizado aplicando conceitos como Teoria das Restrições (Eliyahu Goldratt), PDSA (Deming) e Toyota Production System.</description>

      <description>All you need to follow along is a laptop with the Chrome browser!  The default Kubernetes secrets management uses base-64 encoding but it does not manage the lifecycle of sensitive data. How do we inject a secret from an external secrets manager into a Kubernetes application? In this workshop, we’ll cover some tools and patterns that will retrieve secrets from HashiCorp Vault and inject them into a Kubernetes application.</description>

      <description>All organizations need to protect certain secrets that are required for deploying and maintaining their infrastructure and applications. Additionally, these organizations may have different legal, business, or technical standards or requirements that must be met with regards to storing and securing these secrets. Generally, secrets can include everything from application credentials to SSH keys, tokens, users and passwords, API keys, service accounts, cryptographic keys, database logins, SaaS logins and more.</description>

      <description>Balancing business requirements with security initiatives is tough. Not only are you concerned with scale, latency, resiliency, availability AND delivery of new features, but you also have to pore through mostly generic, sometimes contradictory guidance and &amp;lsquo;hair on fire&amp;rsquo; exclamations from security claiming that the end is nigh because there&amp;rsquo;s an instance of cross site scripting on a help page. Is cross site scripting really that bad in this case?</description>

      <description>ABN AMRO is transforming to a DevOps way of working and security is an important aspect of this. The CISO department has started a security movement for all employees to gain security knowledge, so they can work on security themselves. For DevOps teams this is even more important, as they need to develop and release quickly. Daphne Ma will tell you about this journey and the role of security advising.</description>

      <description>As the practices and benefits of DevOps have spread over the years, we’ve seen a drastic improvement in the speed and efficiency organizations are able to gain in their development pipelines. This was achieved in large part by giving Development engineers and Operations engineers a common language to speak and goal to accomplish. Security reviews, however, still remain a bottleneck or are overlooked entirely, which leads to increased risk, especially as speed increases.</description>

      <description>It’s usually assumed that when a user says “but I have a secure password” that they don’t; however, a lack of security isn’t always due to lack of knowledge. With increasingly large and complex IT environments, it’s becoming more and more difficult to keep up with securing all the components. Of particular interest, what about ensuring that your logs and audit trails themselves are secure? This is what I will be focusing on, in particular how to:</description>

      <description>Currently there is a lot of buzz around the idea of securing your physical supply chain using blockchains. This seems like a pretty good idea: You can always verify that the physical goods on a journey have taken. But what about your other supply chain, the one that ships software from the brains of developers into the hands of users?
In this talk I want to give an overview about the steps necessary to make sure that only validated code without known vulnerabilities can be shipped off.</description>

      <description>Listen to author and evangelist John Willis describe the “Seven Deadly Diseases of Devops” with a focus on the most costly of them all - Security and Compliance Theater.
This presentation will drill in on the practices needed to create long-term systemic “safe” improvement. Understanding these key patterns enables an organization to focus mainly on the intersection of human capital and technology. Although prescriptive practices like Lean, Agile, SAFE and even DevOps may be necessary for IT acceleration they are in most cases not sufficient for long-term systemic improvement.</description>

      <description>Software development is pressed for faster and faster release cycles with acceptable quality, budget and security. As movements like CI, CD and Devops aim to cut down on release cycles, it’s security’s job to help control the risk. The risk landscape is complex as modern development practices increasingly consume more and more third-party code. Traditional methods do not cut it anymore - it’s time for DevSecOps. This session gives an overview of how companies have implemented DevSecOps practices in their own delivery pipelines and how this can help increase developer awareness of risks affecting them.</description>

      <description>Today we are talking a lot about security, data protection, prvacy, but we are forget one pretty important stuff, a secure code. Normally most of IT professionals or security experts expect attack from outside. But what if the real enemy is our code? Many times we see that someone from developers forget to delete credentials from code, or just hard-code passwords, database endpoints, etc. From security perspective its very hard to detect it if app is already deployed.</description>

      <description>This talk will argue that DevOps could be the best thing to happen to application security since OWASP, if developers and operations teams are enabled to make security a part of their everyday work. With a ratio of 100/10/1 for Development, Operations, and Security, security now needs to concentrate on creating tools, processes and opportunities for dev and ops that result in more-secure products, instead of trying to do it all themselves like they did in days past.</description>

      <description>We now have lots of &amp;ldquo;tools&amp;rdquo; for operations in cloud-native. Yet they all seem to suffer from the impact of single POV. And at the same time, we have more complexity, in infrastructure with the adoption of orchestration, cloud elasticity, microservices and FaaS. Piled on with heavily request-driven models, the old style of reacting to anomalies and headaches fails.
With RED, unlike the modern belief in metrics, your architecture is watched from aspects of multiple dimensions.</description>

      <description>RED (Rates, Errors, Duration) was a spinoff from Google’s Golden Signals designed for monitoring microservices. However, RED use has clearly demonstrated that the applicability is applicable to any services-based architecture.
With RED, unlike the modern belief in observability, your architecture is watched from aspects of multiple dimensions. You receive alerts and indications not just from anomalies, but also from headache alerts. By seeing multiple dimensions of concerns, be they failures in service or activity to close to the edge of capability, these combined monitors and deep-dive, focused access get you to your root cause faster, with less false positives and quicker resolution.</description>

      <description>The ability to monitor infrastructure has been exploding with new tools on the market and new integrations, so the tools can speak to one another, leading to even more tools, and to a hypothetically very loud monitoring environment with various members of the engineering team finding themselves muting channels, individual alerts, or even alert sources so they can focus long enough to complete other tasks. There has to be a better way - a way to configure comprehensive alerts that send out notifications with the appropriate level of urgency to the appropriate persons at the appropriate time.</description>

      <description>In 2010 there was a first serverless provider PiCloud, by 2019 every major company providing cloud do Server-less including Microsoft, Oracle, Google and Amazon. You can much more easily scale your applications, get rid of infrastructure management and develop more beautiful code.
If you believe that AWS Lambda functions are just about short Python code, think again. You can develop complex event-driven architecture with logging, scaling, debugging, CI/CD pipelines and much more.</description>

      <description>For any company, there will always be technical debts that you have to deal with as technology evolves. Whether it’s revamping a site, refactoring or optimizing an application, or adding new features, you always want to find new and better ways to make improvements.
You might want to consider serverless architecture if you’re interested in reducing the cost of development and operations for your next project. Serverless architecture is based on a cloud computing execution model, it is driven by events, and its resources are dynamically managed and automatically scaled by the cloud providers.</description>

      <description>Some thought leaders believe that Serverless practices will replace Devops practices, when the reality is totally different. There are no separate &amp;ldquo;Serverless practices&amp;rdquo;, and the first step in success using serverless platforms is adopting DevOps practices.
Description The DevOps mindset &amp;amp; practices are key to successful Serverless adoption. This talk will dive into the common DevOps practices that are used in successful Serverless adoption, and how DevOps equips you with a transferable set of skills and the mindset required for operating modern platforms.</description>

      <description>From AWS to Google Cloud, the major cloud providers offer different options to run a MySQL or a MySQL compatible database on the cloud. The new trend is serverless (relational) databases like Aurora Serverless that offer both traditional interfaces and HTTP API access. Can serverless databases really be the future? Can data API really replace MySQL connectors? What are the major limitations?</description>

      <description>As DevOps was disruptive to operations, serverless will start a new disruption cycle. We will see more of our operational responsibilities removed again. To define our new role we will need to understand how serverless will effect us and where our value is to our organizations.
With the rise of serverless architecture, many of the common day-to-day operations tasks will change dramatically, if not disappear completely. We as operations professionals will be challenged to redefine our roles and responsibilities within the technology organization as serverless abstracts away the server and its respective OS to cloud service providers.</description>

      <description>The pay-per-invocation model of serverless is such an under-appreciated superpower. It lets you work out the cost of each user transaction and understand the return on investment of features. It can even open the door for new business models and pricing strategies once you embrace it.
A lot of the discussions around serverless has been about the benefits it brings to the table with regards to DevOps - more infrastructure automation, scalability and resilience out-of-the-box.</description>

The talk will cover concepts from the Service Level Indicators (SLI) definition and how to make them universally accessible and useful with graphs and alerts to how to define how good a service should be.</description>

      <description>A primeira geração de micro-serviços, foram primeiramente construídas em cima do Netflix OSS e mais algumas anotações do Spring Cloud annotations misturados com a lógica de negócios. A próxima geração de micro-serviços utilizará sidecars e service mesh. Nesta sessão, você terá um contato com Envoy e Istio. Dois projetos opensource que irão mudar a forma que você escreve aplicações Java usando Kubernetes. Vejo como utilizar o Envoy e o Isto para gerenciar o tráfego, introduzir falhar A/B testing, dark launches, mirroring, e talvez muito mais.</description>

      <description>In our quest to secure all the things, do we jump in too quickly? We&amp;rsquo;ll use Istio and Linkerd as example service meshes, and look at the features we would expect from a service mesh. We&amp;rsquo;ll dive into the day-1 experience with both Istio and Linkerd, and some advanced scenarios of using the service mesh. We&amp;rsquo;ll compare this to border security with an app gateway, and compare and contrast the security features, complexities, and implementation costs.</description>

      <description>Last year the Slack development team and operations teams were living in different worlds. Development teams deployed to production over a hundred times a day, and a centralized operations team tried to fix things when they broke. The operations teams struggled to support systems they had not written. Heros and knowledge islands saved the day over and over. Post-incident meetings were poorly attended and did not encourage learning.
Slowly, then quickly, all that changed.</description>

      <description>Service Virtualization is a recognized technique for improving the SDLC from development to testing in several ways including reducing costs of development, enhancing the flexibility of the testing environment, and overall reduction for the services time to market. While these benefits are discussed often, it can still be unclear how an organization can start utilizing Service Virtualization to suite their specific needs.
In this session I will discuss how organizations can navigate the nuances of service virtualization starting from the decision to incorporate it into the SDLC to executing the technique successfully across multiple different teams.</description>

      <description>Chat bots/integrations have been around since the IRC days. Now more known as ChatOps, these integrations have found a place in the DevOps world. Many organizations of all sizes have integrated chat integrations to aid in everyday tasks, such as deployments. With today’s trend of migrating applications to cloud and serverless, why should our chat bots and integrations be left behind?
Malwarebytes began to raise Shiba during the mid 2018’s to address growing pains and feature requests to a legacy chat integration.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard about the promise of DevOps, and the benefits of things like automation, microservices, containers and Cloud-native architecture. A lot of this is grounded in legitimate innovation and real-world success, but what about the struggles that often go along with it? It may not always be the case, but in our experience, change can be difficult, frustrating and challenging to the whole organization.
For every destination, we must decide, whether to take the scenic route or the shortcut.</description>

      <description>Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a set of principles, practices, and organizational constructs that seek to balance the reliability of a service with the need to continually deliver new features. An error budget is the primary construct used to help balance these seemingly competing goals.
This workshop introduces error budgets and their components: service level indicators (SLIs) and service level objectives (SLOs). Participants will learn the art of creating and implementing SLOs through a series of guided discussions and group exercises.</description>

This workshop introduces error budgets and their components: service level indicators (SLIs) and service level objectives (SLOs). Participants will learn the art of creating and implementing SLOs through a series of guided discussions and group exercises.</description>

      <description>Most organizations have some sort of an IM tool like Slack, Hipchat, MS Teams, and so on. While very helpful in getting quick answers, maintaining a virtual watercooler chat, and sharing cat photos, IM tools have also generated significant backlash as “interruption platforms” and “productivity killers” among people who require uninterrupted concentration to get their work done. Based on years of experience with IM tools at various organizations I offer a number of tips for managing the higher availability requirements of a multi-office, DevOps-embracing company while leaving enough “flow time” for uninterrupted, deep work every day.</description>

      <description>Innovation is how you win customers; reliability is how you keep them. To succeed, you need both. But as organizations adopt Service Level Objectives (SLOs) as part of their Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices, they become fixated on reliability and innovation suffers.
In this talk, I’ll discuss why you need to spend more time on innovation and how to do it. I’ll also share how you can escape your everyday toil and stressful firefighting to rediscover the fun in engineering—and help your company succeed at the same time!</description>

      <description>I was recently reading the book Space Barons which discusses the privatized space race, and it points out how Blue Origin takes on an outward appearance of slow and steady. In the book they mention the company’s unofficial motto of “slow is smooth, smooth is fast”.
That statement resonated with me in that my DevOps career has been focused on strategic planning, careful implementation, and then once the framework is in place, stepping on the gas.</description>

      <description>Should I add features to my app making it truly cloud native or should I use smart infrastructure that make me going faster with no need to code? Is service mesh hype reasonable or should I rather look into more application oriented platforms like serverless frameworks or DAPR? When I have Kafka SDK in my app does it make it less portable, because I have bound code with infrastructure decision? And why this debate started in 80s and is still going on today?</description>

      <description>We’ve all worked for or with an asshole. It’s awkward - we don’t like it, and most of the time we don’t know how to handle it. Is it worth putting up with an asshole boss - or is it time to cut your losses and leave? Learn about best practices to avoid working with or becoming a toxic asshole.

      <title>So. Many. Vulnerabilities. Why are containers such a mess and what to do about it.</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve even run a vulnerability scan on a container you&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen it: the dreaded list with 100s, maybe even 1000s of issues on it. Containers have made life simpler in so many ways, but security sometimes doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like one of them. So what can we do about it?
In this talk I&amp;rsquo;ll share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned working with users and companies and the best practices I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up along the way to builds safer container images.</description>

      <description>Every product either dies a hero or lives long enough to hit Reliability issues. While you go about fixing this, What is the cost, both in terms of effort and business lost, of failure and how much does each nine of reliability cost?
The talk considers a sample and straightforward product and evaluates the depths of each failure point. We take one fault at a time and introduce incremental changes to the architecture, the product, and the support structure like monitoring and logging to detect and overcome those failures.</description>

      <description>Micro-services are social beings: they can’t function without talking with other services. Every microservice has its own domain, and it usually relies on other micro-services to function properly. But this also raises an interesting question: do we trust all of our micro-services? The truth is that not all micro-services are the same: some micro-services are more sensitive - for example, services that handle user data. Others are user-facing and therefore riskier.</description>

      <description>Do you currently have a single staging / development environment, that everyone uses? Does this cause problems when multiple people need to make changes at once? With the latest advances in Infrastructure as Code tooling, you can now move your team away from shared, static cloud environments and give each developer their own dynamic, isolated environments - speeding up their development processes and reducing overhead for your SRE team.</description>

      <description>KEYNOTE TALK ABSTRACT What does it take to innovate quickly? I’ll address how blockers to innovation – including culture, skills, antiquated processes, and board level concerns – can stand in the way of business agility. We’ll map out a pathway to digital transformation including new metrics for success, integrating real-world best practices from enterprises, and the most effective organizational patterns, as we integrate the business with development and operations.</description>

 There are no badge scanners, so you&amp;rsquo;ll need a way to collect entries Most of the attendees will not have business cards.</description>

      <description>We know many of our sponsors intend to do some sort of drawing / lottery at the event. This is a great way to ask attendees to opt-in to receiving more information with you in the future. How you run your drawing is completely up to you, but we have some suggestions.
 There are no badge scanners, so you&amp;rsquo;ll need a way to collect entries Most of the attendees will not have business cards.</description>

      <description>Construimos alguns componentes automatizados baseado em nossos processos, ou seja, independente do skill dos integrantes da squad, todos são capazes de iniciar o desenvolvimento de um microservice/api/componente/app no mesmo dia do seu onboarding/setup do projeto/cliente, diminuindo o curva de aprendizado e agregando mais rapidamente as entregas de valor dos sprints/releases, com pouco conhecimento (setup e onbording) os colaboradores iniciam no fluxo de desenvolvimento de uma forma simples e de fácil entendimento, nossas ferramentas de produtividade aceleram isso ao máximo, como por exemplo: Nossa ferramenta e capaz de gerar Scaffolds de projetos baseados em varias tecnologias com diversos templates e tutoriais de boas praticas de codificação fazendo assim uma padronização entre equipes e clientes (Architecture &amp;amp; Coding Guidance).</description>

      <title>SRE - Using Error Budgets to Prioritize Work</title>
      <link>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-galway/program/nathen-harvey/</link>

      <description>Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a set of principles, practices, and organizational constructs that seek to balance the reliability of a service with the need to continually deliver new features. An error budget is the primary construct used to help balance these seemingly competing goals.
This is an introduction to error budgets and their components: service level indicators (SLIs) and service level objectives (SLOs). We will discuss the art of creating and implementing SLOs.</description>

      <description>Taming the complex distributed systems we&amp;rsquo;re responsible for requires changing not just the tools and technical approaches we use; it also requires changing who is involved in production, how they collaborate, and how we measure success.
In this talk, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn about several practices core to production excellence: giving everyone a stake in production, collaborating to ensure observability, measuring with Service Level Objectives, and prioritizing improvements using risk analysis.</description>

      <description>No matter how you define it, the Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) role is clearly expanding into more and more companies. To be effective in this new role, SREs must possess a depth of understanding of how different systems work together, how they fail, how they can be improved, and how they can best be designed and monitored.
Here are the steps you&amp;rsquo;ll need to gain acceptance and maximize your effectiveness, whether you’re still figuring out how to create a site reliability practice at your company or you’re trying to improve the processes and habits of an existing SRE team.</description>

      <description>TALK ABSTRACT On cloud, traditional policy agent based provisioning of SSO becomes a huge bottleneck for scaling at will and diversity on demand. By centralizing the policy enforcement into a centralized pass through layer we de-coupled app teams to realize maximum benefits offered by cloud.
Here is a set of our accomplishments at a very high level, that I would like to share as part of the talk:
 Seamless/ transparent scaling, updating of authentication/ security layer, with zero touchpoint to application infrastructure.</description>

      <description>Do you hear a lot about continuous delivery and DevOps? Do you love what you hear but you don&amp;rsquo;t see how you could ever get there with your legacy code? Have you done a first attempt to add automated tests (e.g. with selenium and cucumber) but they keep on failing and don&amp;rsquo;t lead to the expected return on investment?
In this workshop you will see how to approach continuous delivery in legacy codebases using a fast and maintainable automated test suite, mainly based on unit tests.</description>

      <description>This talk describes the journey of building a brand new, platform-first, microservices architecture at Box. Building a new architectural stack presents a bunch of challenges with design choices, technology selection, and balancing simplicity with richness of feature offerings. A ‘steel thread’ to designing architectures helps identify the critical components of the stack and then gradually roll out incremental features - all while the engine is still running. The challenges really snowball when you on-board live traffic with high scale, high throughput and low latency requirements.</description>

      <description>Software should be easy to use. It should also try to stop you from hitting yourself. A lot of modern successful software has easy to use defaults which makes getting started really simple. The problem is that the &amp;ldquo;getting started experience&amp;rdquo; often turns into &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo; before the users or application are really ready for it. This talk covers the common mistakes that users run into when going into production with Kubernetes and proposes a potential solution for how we can prevent this from happening in the future.</description>

      <title>Strong Consistency in Databases. What Does it Actually Guarantee?</title>

      <description>Distributed data stores are subject to the CAP theorem, and historically NoSQL distributed systems have chosen availability over consistency. This has been changing, yet many famous databases are still AP only.
In Eric Brewer&amp;rsquo;s 2012 follow-up article about the CAP theorem he stated: &amp;lsquo;Availability is obviously continuous from 0 to 100 percent, but there are also many levels of consistency, and even partitions have nuances, including disagreement within the system about whether a partition exists.</description>

      <description>Normalmente as aplicações utilizam diversos serviços, e são instaladas em vários ambientes diferentes, tornando a sua instalação e configuração bastante trabalhosa.
Por vezes configurações importantes são mantidas diretamente no código causando inúmeros problemas. Mas as coisas não precisam ser assim: seja num projeto novo ou legado, você tem outras opções.
Nesta palestra veremos um breve resumo da metodologia dos doze fatores e como eles podem nos ajudar a melhorar nossos projetos e o fluxo de instalação da sua aplicação.</description>

      <description>Knative allows developers not only to address the challenges of using managed services, but also, they can jump into the serverless world easier without specific expertise of Linux containers, Kubernetes, or cloud infrastructure platform. But what does this really look like if you&amp;rsquo;re, say, a Java developer? What else the developer needs for serverless application?
In this session, you will learn how supersonic subatomic Java, Quarkus with Knative makes developer’s life change super-fast beyond your imagination for cloud-native, serverless application development via a live demo.</description>

      <description>Let’s get one thing straight: building and running applications and services without thinking about servers sound like a good idea. But are we ready to do so?
You want to build web applications without servers? You have got to be kidding! Do I? In my talk, I will share my experience of building microservices-based web applications without a single server. No shortcuts. No going easy. I will cover all crucial components like front-end, back-end, SQL and NoSQL databases, a message bus or background processing.</description>

      <description>Ops people – even DevOps people! – and product managers don’t always see eye-to-eye. (You want how many nines?!?) In my 20+ year career, I’ve been a sysadmin, a product manager, and everything in between. In this talk, I’ll call out some of the tensions between these groups, and propose some techniques for working together toward common goals. There will be lots of snark about how product people are awful, sugarcoated with some touchy-feely stuff about how to make peace.</description>

      <description>TALK ABSTRACT Some DevOps transformations flourish, but others are stalling. Why is that? This talk will make the case that Operations is the most predictable differentiator. So much of the energy in DevOps has been about activities that start in Dev and move towards Ops — continuous delivery, deployment pipelines, automated testing, and of course, the unofficial mantra of “deploy, deploy, deploy. “However, post-deployment, too many DevOps transformations maintain the status quo and leave questionable Operations practices in place.</description>

      <description>25 years ago, I was working as a sysadmin for a dial-up ISP and today, I lead the Cloud Native developer experience group at VMware. Spoiler alert: my day to day tasks haven&amp;rsquo;t changed all that much. How have we progressed over the past quarter century and what clues does that give us for what&amp;rsquo;s coming in the future? The journey so far has been rocky but still productive and fruitful.</description>

      <description>Complex systems fail. Failures are a normal occurrence and how the system responds to component failures determines if the system is resilient or if it results in an incident. This is true not just for Information Systems but also for industrial and mechanical systems. Users can learn from the experience of these systems on what common themes permeate and how to best build our software factories to minimize the effect of component failures and prevent incidents from becoming accidents.</description>

      <description>Motivación Los sistemas de monitoreo proporcionan una gran cantidad de métricas y datos en tiempo real, lo que da lugar al desafío de la óptima utilización de dicha información. En la mayoría de los casos se utilizan unos pocos datos que en determinados valores indican una situación no deseada, lo que genera una alerta. Esto resulta en una enorme cantidad de información desaprovechada, tanto métricas que a priori no aportan información de utilidad para alertar de situaciones indeseadas, como los datos que debido a no estar en estados de alarma, no son analizados.</description>

En este contexto, la diversidad de conocimientos y habilidades necesarias para desempeñarse como especialista en seguridad de la información contribuyen a la aparición del &amp;ldquo;Síndrome del Impostor&amp;rdquo;. Esta charla proporcionará información para identificarlo y superarlo.

      <description>At Granular, we believe success in the cloud means taking a &amp;ldquo;software-first&amp;rdquo; approach rather than clicking around in the console, creating pet servers, or troubleshooting manual deployments. While today we run multiple accounts with fully-automatic, version controlled infrastructure changes, it was not always so! Over the past 3 years, we have worked to transition from a semi-automated, loosely controlled environment to a fully-automated, self-serve, robust set of AWS accounts.
Retrospectively - we should have taken an software-first approach from the start.</description>

      <description>You sometimes hear that DevOps and IT service management (ITSM)/ITIL® aren’t compatible. As a former Change Manager, I can see clearly that organizations that are successfully adopting DevOps practices aren’t achieving that success without ITSM. Nor do they become high performing with overly-rigorous ITSM processes. This is particularly true when it comes to the dreaded IT change management process. The key message of this ignite talk is that we can all agree on the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of the change management process.</description>

      <description>O bode está na sala. O assunto qualidade em Infraestrutura deve ser abordado com mais intensidade do que vem sido ultimamente, pois é cobrado cada vez mais dos profissionais de desenvolvimento que sejam aplicadas boas práticas de testes no seu dia a dia, e por quê agora a infra também virou código isso também não cobrado dos profissionais de Operações?
Esta talk visa trazer a discussão e tentar responder essa pergunta tão complicada nos dias atuais.</description>

      <description>Some docker containers run entire apps, web server, DB, business logic, and so on. They are created using code. How do you know nothing breaks when you modify it? How do you document what your container contains? Let’s explore together how to test and even TDD your next docker container.
We take unit tests, integration tests, functional tests and so on for granted. The application must be tested and when the complexity grows the app must keep working, so we test it.</description>

      <description>Service meshes give you a great set of features “for free”, but only on top of a Kubernetes environment. If you’re not building something brand new, you probably have VMs, physical servers, even mainframes. Why should the start-up kids have all the fun? Let’s add “old infrastructure” to the mesh too.</description>

      <description>Career paths in tech can often feel black and white; start as an intern, and then move from associate, to mid-level, to senior to architect—but what if you aren’t happy no matter how high you go? How do you pivot? Where do you pivot? Is it too late to pivot? What if it’s not just a pivot, but a cliff jump? Technology is one of the few industries that has almost limitless opportunity for growth in any direction, but knowing how to shift directions is a problem many people face.</description>

Celebrating 100 years of operational excellence, CN is a world-class transportation leader and the only transcontinental railway in North America. Our 19,500 mile network spans Canada and Mid-America, connecting three coasts. A true backbone of the economy, CN handles over $250 billion worth of goods, hauls about 20% of Canada’s exports and carries more than 300 million tons of cargo annually.
As CN modernizes operations and builds the digital railroad of the future, our strategy is predicated upon building the right technical foundations and enablers that help future proof operations and safely deliver value throughout the supply chain.</description>

      <description>It is easy to get started with Terraform to manage infrastructure as code. Just read the documentation on terraform.io, and you are done. Almost.
The harder part begins when infrastructure grows in all directions (several AWS/GCP accounts, regions, teams, projects, environments, external integrations). One of the most frequent questions is &amp;ldquo;how to structure code&amp;rdquo;.
In this workshop, I will explain many of challenges related to that, what works, what does not work, why so, and most importantly I will show all the code which works from small projects to very-large infrastructures (featuring multi-cloud and multi-region setup).</description>

      <description>Continuous testing is one of the most effective ways of building quality into the continuous delivery pipeline; yet it is difficult to implement in practice. It involves more than test automation. Although test automation is a must; continuous risk analysis and optimizing the test suite is critical so that the automated suites doesn’t become a bottleneck in the continuous integration pipeline. In this presentation, you’ll learn how to implement an effective continuous test strategy throughout the continuous delivery pipeline.</description>

      <description>Comenzando desde la evolución de Waterfall a Agile y luego de Agile a DevOps, la cultura DevOps se ha ido perfeccionando y cada paso ha traído consigo cambios en las funcionalidades de los diferente roles existentes dentro de un proyecto y el rol del tester no ha quedado fuera de estos.
DevOps promueve la colaboración entre los diferentes roles de un equipo y fomenta la ideología de estar alineados con un objetivo común que es lograr plazos de entregas más cortos y frecuentes con una mayor calidad y a un menor costo.</description>

      <description>How do you know your feature is working perfectly in production? If something breaks in production, how will you know? Will you wait for a user to report it to you? What do you do when your staging test results do not reflect current production behavior? In order to test proactively as opposed to reactively, try testing in production! You will have an increased accuracy of test results, your tests will run faster due to elimination of bad data, and you will have higher confidence before releases.</description>

A database company&amp;rsquo;s CTO claims updates between two data centers 6633km apart in less than a millisecond? Absolutely! Their technology is so fast, they&amp;rsquo;ve discovered a way to move TCP/IP packets faster than light.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;This will never work here&amp;rdquo; is the sentiment we often hear from companies just starting their DevOps transformation. The good news is that change is possible. In this talk, Sasha will explain how Microsoft moved from the three-year waterfall software delivery cycle to deploying multiple times a day. Using the example of the live engineering environment for Azure DevOps Services, Sasha will walk through the process of updating older systems, transforming the automated tests, implementing CI/CD, and the major cultural changes that were needed to make it all possible.</description>

      <description>The widespread adoption of test automation has led to numerous challenges that range from development lifecycle integration to simple scripting strategy. Just because a scenario CAN be automated does not mean it SHOULD be automated. Teams that adopt automation often rush to automate everything they can – the automation firehose. For those scenarios that should automated, every team must adopt an implementation plan to ensure value is derived from reliable automated test execution.</description>

      <description>When my team chooses to run infrastructure on AWS, the breadth of services enables rapid prototyping and the elasticity of the cloud enables immense scale. This flexibility comes at a cost, reflected in the complex, sometimes opaque, bill we receive at the end of the month. Deciphering the bill is joint effort between data science, engineering, and finance. Using the bill to understand our usage requires a data warehouse and enough SQL to power 1000 homes in Seattle.</description>

      <description>What is resilience? What is resilience engineering? This talk will ground your understanding of those terms using the compelling example of bone. Bone is the archetype of resilience and medicine the archetype of resilience engineering. The features of bone development, maintenance, and repair are graceful extensibility and sustained adaptability. They give the skeleton its capacity to grow, to retain strength, to remodel in the face of stress, and to repair damage.</description>

      <description>According to The DevOps Handbook, the First Way focuses on Fast Flow. Of course. Adopt trunk-based development, write automated tests, setup a CI/CD pipeline. With this, teams should be shipping business value wicked fast. So why aren’t we? What are the things still slowing us down?
In this session, we’ll introduce the practice of Value Stream Mapping, and how we can leverage lean principles and systems thinking to help uncover the things that slow us down.</description>

      <description>Modern systems have resulted in an explosion of complexity for organizations of every size, shape, and purpose. In an effort to create more resilient and reliable software, we’ve cast around for solutions to tame and manage this complexity. Observability practices have come to be seen as essential for operating systems at scale, but in practice they’re often seen as technical solutions to what is ultimately a social problem: Software, at the end of the day, is built and run by people.</description>

      <description>The data is very sensitive for the bank, and therefore banks have very high standards of the cyber security. However, there are still a lot of challenge to promote DevSecOps culture.
Since 2018, we starts to integrate Cyber Security into DevOps culture by running DevSecOps program. We aim to shift left the Cyber security mindset to the development teams through promoting DevSecOps tools combined with the relevant trainings.
In this presentation, we will share how to integrate DevSecOps tools, such as Checkmarx, Contrast and Sonatype IQ into development CICD pipeline to produce vulnerability reports through cyber security testing and scanning source code and 3rd party libraries.</description>

      <description>Back in the day, a mobile phone was just that – a phone. Now they have gotten smart. Humor has been programmed into our Amazon Echo and Google Home devices.
We talk about our computers like they are humans. We give them names. We talk to them. We refer to them as having human characteristics. “My computer is sleeping.” “My phone is dying.”
At the same time, we are dehumanizing people.</description>

      <description>Containers have been the future for five years now, featured on the stage of every major distributed systems conference in the world. But beyond the hype and the swag is a real technical solution, with real technical challenges, used for real problems at scale. And for the companies and engineers looking to adopt this solution, there’s little content on what awaits them.
In this talk, we’ll discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of running containers, in production, at scale.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing on the wrong part of CALMS. Sure you can set incentives, you can reorganize and adopt SCRUM, but rarely does one achieve a devops culture through business led &amp;ldquo;digital transformation&amp;rdquo;. Paul will talk about the concrete steps that you as a leader, or you as a practitioner can utilize Automation, Measurement, and Sharing within a Lean framework and move the needle and drive towards a DevOps culture by doing the work and proving value.</description>

      <title>The danger of DevOps Certifications</title>

      <description>There are many people who poke fun at DevOps certifications, usually questioning the value. There are also a lot of companies who want people who hold them.
I believe this specific type of certification is worse than “not valuable”, and is actively harmful. This talk explains why.
When the first DevOps certifications became available several events had a bit of fun with it. DevOpsDays Berlin stamped “DevOps Certified” on every attendee’s badge.</description>

      <description>The infrastructure space is bursting with activity, with cloud computing and containerization leading the charge. New software, new approaches, new tools, and new dogma. And at the forefront of nearly every conversation about all these new developments, is &amp;ldquo;scale&amp;rdquo;. But when did &amp;ldquo;scale&amp;rdquo; become synonymous with &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo;?
Most of us aren&amp;rsquo;t building search engines. Most of us aren&amp;rsquo;t exclusively running distributed microservices with service meshes in Golang. The IT masses are running Rails and PHP and MySQL and commercial off-the-shelf software.</description>

      <description>Following every release of a complicated project is the inevitable postmortem, an opportunity for everyone to get together to discuss what went wrong and what could have been done better. When I think of complicated fictitious projects none is more complicated than the Death Star from Star Wars. Not only was it a weapon with the capability of destroying an entire planet from quite some distance away but it was also a moon sized city.</description>

      <title>The definitive guide to make software fail on ARM64s</title>

      <description>Cloudflare operates a large distributed network: we have more than 150 data centres across 75 countries. We recently decided to integrate a second CPU architecture into our infrastructure. The obvious choice was ARM64. Apart from doing the basic hardware bring up we also needed to port all our software stack to ARM64, which includes a lot of in-house and third-party open-source components. Turns out, even if the software is written in a cross-platform architecture-agnostic language, there are a lot of potential ways it can fail on a different architecture.</description>

      <description>Context This talk reports a real-world experience regarding a DevOps adoption at BancoBPI. BancoBPI is one of the top five banks in Portugal. Our IT division is bigger than most SME IT companies in Portugal are. We manage a vast and heterogeneous IT ecosystem. More than 80 development teams are responsible for developing hundreds of application components and thousands of services. These application components and services are spread across different platforms, that span from the decades-old Mainframe platform, where we still have some applications from the ’80s, to the cutting edge mobile platforms for iOS and Android apps.</description>

      <description>Spotify recently hit an internal milestone for our number of incidents, something that was met with celebration, custom stickers, and appreciation for the way we engage in technical operations. Spotify didn&amp;rsquo;t always start out with such a culture, and it took a variety of changes in the way DevOps, incident handling, and infrastructure were done here before such a milestone was met with fanfare in lieu of blame or shame. Learn how Spotify has over the years crafted a blameless learning culture where developers are happy to go oncall, postmortems are spirited, constructive discussions, and &amp;ldquo;blame the process, not the people&amp;rdquo; is our DevOps mantra.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes helps us tame sprawling microservices architectures and addressing the increased operational complexity. Kubernetes gives developers abstractions and APIs to deploy and run their services.
Yet, the elephant in the room is that to run, maintain and evolve the Kubernetes clusters, we need more ops expertise and most likely a dedicated team to do so.
The question that begs to be asked is if we are going back to pre-DevOps isolation between Dev and Ops teams?</description>

      <description>If World War III broke out and you wanted to check the Internet was still operational the only thing you would do is try Google.com.
Why? Because Google is so agonizingly reliable. They realized one thing:
The prerequisite to success is reliability.
In Contino’s extensive experience in the enterprise, SRE helps turn fragile, error prone enterprise computing into robust systems. Even further, with Contino’s Enterprise Site Reliability Engineering (eSRE), you can tap into your organization’s ability to connect technology decisions to the customer experience (or business decisions).</description>

      <description>In the beginning DevOps was an experiment to improve the collaboration just between Dev and Ops people. Today DevOps is often seen as tooling, as many tremendous changes in IT happened since then: the rise of container technology, Microservices, Public Cloud Services, Serverless and Infrastructure as Code - just to name a few of them. But DevOps is much more than technology and tooling. Books like ‚The Phoenix Project‘ were an eye opener to the process and people aspects of DevOps.</description>

      <description>Everyone is talking about running a hybrid cloud but does anyone really knows what that model should look like? In this talk we are going to explore five marks that organizations share as they move to a hybrid cloud operating model. These marks are:
Goals over technologies - My goals should define my technology
High Immutability - I should DRY (don’t repeat myself) out everything I can as I move from Development to Production</description>

      <description>Ten years into the DevOps revolution, many organizations have embraced and adopted the key principles, such as collaboration, containerization, infrastructure as code, automation of build, test, review, and deployment, and &amp;ndash; perhaps most importantly &amp;ndash; culture shift.
But many challenges still lie ahead.</description>

      <title>The Good, the Bad and the Very Ugly in Structuring IT Organizations</title>

      <description>If &amp;lsquo;DevOps&amp;rsquo; is anything, it concerns how we structure the various functions collaborating to manage information technology. Changing the organization of people to support high performance is one of the hardest and riskiest changes, but it can bring huge benefits. Unfortunately, many people think there is such a thing as &amp;lsquo;best&amp;rsquo; organizational structure. Or they believe that you can improve your structure by emulating some other organization. However, we benefit most from changes in organizational structure if we think of it in terms of a dialectic evolution responding to current issues, but also giving rise to its own new issues.</description>

      <description>The Great British Bake Off (GBBO) is a reality TV show where amateur bakers compete in a series of challenges designed to test their knowledge, creativity and technical ability in baking. GBBO has taken the world by storm, and is popular for its feel good, light-hearted and positive content. All the contestants work hard, excel at their craft, take their failures/lessons gracefully and cheer each other on. When you’re used to reality TV shows being, cutthroat, negative and greed induced this outlier seems so special and unique.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CIOs and line-of-business executives are at the forefront of a major transformation aimed at leveraging the competitive advantages of the new hyper-connected enterprise. New IT for mobile devices, cloud services, social networks and big data analytics belong to the third platform, the next generation compute platform. We call this evolution to the third platform the “Idea Economy” because it gives IT the ability to drive new business opportunities by quickly delivering revenue-generating products, services, and experiences.</description>

      <description>Is the IJ a river or a lake? Perhaps it’s neither. It’s sometimes been called a bay and often is called simply—and ambiguously—a body of water. Over centuries, the shape of the IJ has changed. By looking at the history of the IJ and how its changes have impacted the landscape and people of Holland, I’ll share how we can map DevOps &amp;amp; learn lessons from the shifting shape of DevOps.</description>

How easily and quickly can you find the documentation you need, the data you need, and drill down into where the problem is? A good dashboard can and should provide the context you want, and act as a dynamic source of documentation. Also known as, a brief overview of how dashboards can be more than just raw data, and how they should act as a web, linking to each other, your documentation, and your internal tooling.</description>

      <description>At Honeycomb, we often hear from teams who know they need to build a culture of observability, but are intimidated by all of the work — especially instrumentation code — they&amp;rsquo;ll need to get there. This talk covers our product engineering team&amp;rsquo;s own incremental journey moving from metrics to events to traces, and discusses some valuable things we learned using our instrumentation at each phase of the process. The primary focus is on the technical implementation details of each phase of instrumentation and the benefits of each move, but we&amp;rsquo;ll also cover how to hack your existing tools to support you in each step of the process, and talk about when it makes sense to fit instrumentation work into your roadmap.</description>

After some visits to doctors in USA, I ended up with a guy from MIT who introduced me to the #WeAreNotWainting world. This basically means that we cannot wait for the FDA approvals, labs decision, country regulations, in order to have technology that is already available there somewhere.</description>

      <description>Services are the backbone of our systems. They are the pieces that make up our businesses—whether they are literal microservices or functional components of a traditional application, we can’t do the computer thing without services.
When it comes to a service in your company or organization, who’s responsible for it? The cast of characters involved in the lifecycle of a service are more than just software engineers—they can include program managers, product owners, sustainability/SRE/ops, and business stakeholders, just to name a few.</description>

      <description>No matter the size of your business, structure is the key to success. Of course, not just any kind of structure will work; businesses need a structure that is as adaptable and fluid as your business&#39; needs are. For tech businesses, the most popular way to achieve this style of structure is by using Agile and DevOps. While some would argue that either works fine separately, Agile and DevOps truly shine when they are implemented in tandem.</description>

      <description>“This will never work here” is the sentiment we often hear from companies just starting their DevOps transformation. The good news is that change is possible, and even 45-year-old companies can transform themselves! In this talk, Sasha will explain how Microsoft moved from the 3-year waterfall software delivery cycle to deploying multiple times a day!
Using the example of the live engineering environment for Azure DevOps Services, Sasha will walk through the process of updating older systems, transforming the automated tests and implementing CI/CD.</description>

      <description>Job descriptions for senior engineers often require people who can “hit the ground running” or “get in and get stuff done”. In this session, I examine the myth around the “senior engineer” and why people can’t just get in and get stuff done. No matter the engineer’s experience level, codebases are more than just code they represent the values and history of a business.
I address this issue through research conducted by Github and Google along with business management academics into Organisational Socialisation within their own companies but also within the open-source ecosystem.</description>

      <description>I’ll touch on these myths and more: Innersource gives me free developers!; Innersource will fix my bugs; Innersource is more risky; I can Innersource my way out of my current job and into a new one altogether!
I’ll then show an example of the success Innersource has had at Verizon through our Kubernetes journey and MyVerizon, the mobile app millions of customers rely on to manage their Verizon services.</description>

      <description>In October of 2018 a redesigned site for supporting the mission of Recreation.gov went into production. This new system was built from the ground up to provide the best user experience for anyone to safely and sustainably experience some of the United States most prized national treasures. Reservations for campsites at Yosemite National Park, permits to climb half-dome, and tickets to attend the Whitehouse Easter egg hunt are just some of the items for sale.</description>

      <description>For over a decade Northwoods sold and implemented thick-client application, installed on-premises. Over the past three years, Northwoods has designed and built a SaaS offering hosted on AWS, and evolved a collaboration between ops and dev teams to rapidly deliver updates and on-board new customers. At the beginning of the project, deploying a application more often than every 6 months was unheard of, developers did not get frequent feedback about how the applications they built were working, and security was the responsiblity of the customer (who owned the servers and network).</description>

      <description>I was hired for a position called &amp;ldquo;DevOps Engineer&amp;rdquo;. Over the years I tried to prove that DevOps is a culture, not person in product team. Few months ago we started an experiment and detached all DevOps Engineers from their teams to form a group of floating consultants. In this talk I would like to share with you why we wanted to change, what we have changed and how it turned out.</description>

      <description>Developing an internship/apprentice program is hard. But we can&amp;rsquo;t hire senior engineers forever. At some point that pool will run out and if no junior folks are hired into the workforce, there will be no one left. To hire interns, apprentices, and &amp;ldquo;junior&amp;rdquo; engineers, companies must establish stable mentoring and growth paths for engineers to progress.
Just because someone volunteers to be a mentor does not mean they are an effective one.</description>

      <description>DevOps teams now have access to powerful monitoring solutions to track operational data and extract insights into where their work can add the most customer value. But, as IT systems grow in scale and complexity, these teams lose sight of a crucial piece of the puzzle: context.
Without additional information to put context around monitoring and observability data, teams can’t optimize resource allocation and can miss out on vital fixes affecting the customer experience.</description>

      <description>For each PR bitbucket generates {pullRequestId}/merge branch, which simulates state of target branch after merge. To ensure a green trunk we have to run all related builds on this branch. After merge of one PR results of all other open PRs will be rollbacked and you need to restart all related builds because of updated upstream. Accordingly, we get a large number of rebuilds, which is a big problem in a monorepo.</description>

      <description>The widespread adoption of test automation has led to numerous challenges that range from development lifecycle integration to simple scripting strategy. Just because a scenario CAN be automated does not mean it SHOULD be automated. Teams that adopt automation often rush to automate everything they can – the automation firehose. For those scenarios that should automated, every team must adopt an implementation plan to ensure value is derived from reliable automated test execution.</description>

      <description>Albeit being a common industry practice, using the same service provider for network security and acceleration (i.e. DDoS mitigation, WAF, CDN) and for DNS can have adverse effects on a production environment when that provider is compromised. When Cloudflare went down for 27 minutes back in July, during peak time, we found ourselves completely helpless, and were resolved to make sure this doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen again.
This talk will present the process that we&amp;rsquo;ve gone through in order migrate our production DNS zone to another provider, starting from the research process of electing a new provider that would suit our needs, through the creation of a playbook with clear checkpoints and a flashing &amp;ldquo;point-of-no-return&amp;rdquo; and with the actual execution of that playbook.</description>

We make mistakes, don’t take care of ourselves, burn out, experience loss, or get sick. We experience triumphs and successes that distract us from our work. We try and sometimes fail to balance the demands on our time in both our personal and professional lives.</description>

      <description>TALK ABSTRACT The three pillars of observability, namely logs, metrics, and traces, have been raising our industry’s awareness of the three categorical data sources that are indispensable to implement true observability. The need for observability becomes even more obvious and pressing as an organization’s infrastructure and workloads evolve to be more hybrid, distributed, and, inevitably, complex. However, in reality, DevOps professionals a lot of times still face the challenges diversified tool chains and disparate data silos.</description>

      <description>System reliability often appears to be at odds with developer velocity. The faster your org develops and the more frequently you deploy, the more opportunities you create to cause incidents and outages. But standing still or slowing down are not viable alternatives. In this talk, I’ll suggest some specific ideas, metrics, and UX patterns to bridge this dichotomy. By thinking like a product designer about your testing tooling, you can have happier, more productive developers building more stable, resilient systems.</description>

      <description>Tracing can be very powerful. It gives the ability to connect the customer experience to the backend services several hops away. This comes down to what information is in your traces. There isn&amp;rsquo;t one standard set of tags to add for EVERY application. It comes down to how traces are used and what matters to your organization. During this webinar we will discuss the need for tracing, dive into the why (and what) you would want to trace via distributed tracing, and delve into the OpenTelemetry specs and architecture on how we can tailor (or tag) our traces.</description>

      <description>Spoon theory is a metaphor about the finite energy we each have to do things in a day. Different people, especially underrepresented people, have to spend their energy in different ways. Understanding that is crucial to creating environments where our devs can do good work and lead fulfilling lives.

      <description>As developers, our most famous response, “it works on my machine,” doesn’t cut it anymore. We need a way to develop each project in environments that are as identical to production as possible. In this presentation, we learn how to use Visual Studio Code Remote Development to standardize the development environments for each project, remove the need to install third party software like Python or Node, and ensure that when it runs on “my” machine, it runs in production.</description>

      <description>In order to keep your cloud data secure, you have to get inside the minds of those seeking to breach it. Josh Stella explores who cloud attackers are, what motivates them, and the tools and methods they use to exploit our cloud environments and data. Josh is going to simulate two real-world cloud misconfiguration attacks to demonstrate in real-time how these methods work in evading datacenter security approaches and take advantage of common cloud misconfigurations that compliance standards miss.</description>

      <description>During the Agile revolution, the wider software development community discovered the benefits of shifting testing left. The primary benefits included reduced schedule risk, higher team confidence and reduced development costs. Additionally, developers have gotten better at writing functional code and fewer things are found late in the cycle. What if we tried the same with security? Would we see the same benefits? Absolutely! Let’s talk about how to make shift happen in your SDLC.</description>

      <description>We talk a lot about the quality of software. Or more accurately we talk about the lack of quality in software. We try to introduce automated tests, deployments, we do agile, continuous delivery and DevOps, but has that made our software better?
I have trust in a rock to behave as expected, I can not save the same thing for the average piece of software. In this talk I will talk about what the concept of quality means in terms of software.</description>

      <description>DevOps, Serverless, and Wardley Maps, three frames for making sense of the waves of change in IT.
This talk will explore how each of these frames reveals economic and social transitions successful IT Organizations will need to grapple with in the near future.
Moving beyond a modernist organizational concept, large enterprises and startups alike are no longer simply asking “can this be automated (the modernist conception)” and are instead turning towards understanding “what will it mean when this is automated”.</description>

      <description>Logs: they’re not interesting beyond debugging and service monitoring, until you’ve been breached and then everyone wants them. As your security people sift through the logs you find out that the logs aren’t standardized, and the logs on your compromised server have been erased.
Now imagine a different scenario where all the logs are normalized, as most SIEM (Security Incident and Event Management) tools cannot parse custom application logs super well.</description>

This talk introduces the one technique I’ve always returned to when I need to drastically improve teams I’ve joined and led over my 20+ year career in tech. You can use it right away to understand, communicate and improve your work, team or organization - whether you’re a leader or new recruit.</description>

      <description>While the Covid-19 pandemic has forced many individuals to work remotely, now, more than ever, the needs of neurodivergent professionals should be taken into account as we learn how individuals best thrive in a remote work setting.
Where many neurodivergent people may have struggled previously to work in a traditional office setting, remote work allows for flexibility and freedom in where, how, and when one works. Remote work also allows neurodivergent individuals to control aspects of their environment such as noise levels, ambient room temperature, sensory issues, and more.</description>

      <title>To #comment or not? A data-driven look at conflicting attitudes towards commenting and documentation</title>

      <description>Every programmer has asked themselves “how many comments are too many?” To the newest programmers, comments may seem magical–a way of documenting without giving instructions to the computer. But commenting engages the same vulnerability as more advanced challenges (i.e. pair programming &amp;amp; code review) and is likely to pique the insecurity of many programmers (especially the copy-and-paste or tutorial-level programmer)!
While most of us agree that commenting is part of writing maintainable code, it’s very difficult for someone who has not yet worked in a community-reviewed codebase to know what is good practice and not.</description>

      <description>The cloud has changed the way hackers operate, and you need to change how you think about securing your cloud assets against this new generation of exploits.
In this talk, Josh Stella, CTO of Fugue, will walk through a simulation of an advanced cloud misconfiguration exploit. He’ll explain at every step how common—but frequently overlooked—mistakes leave cloud data vulnerable, and how most cloud-based data breaches go undetected, even long after the fact.</description>

      <description>Ten years of DevOps and few businesses changed how they do a very crucial IT aspect: Architecture.
Engineers still deal with domain architects, business architects, enterprise architects and have to receive approvals to design or build applications. These architects live in an ivory tower, surrounded by diagrams, arrows and when confronted with new ideas will recite parchments of Gartner Quadrants to justify their choices. Also, yes, some of them haven&amp;rsquo;t written a line code for 10-15 years&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Microservice architecture brings new challenges for operations, simple logging and metrics cillection might not be enough these days. We will explore together additional component called tracing. This technique is not really new in our industry but there are good reasons why it becomes more and more popular right now. How does it compare to metrics and logging? Can we combine all mentioned together? Let’s find out. We&amp;rsquo;ll uncover some basic concepts of tracing theoretically and practically.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all the tools today to do high frequent deliveries in high quality. Yet many team struggle with getting into fast feedback loops with their customers, as their culture is not fast and responsive enough. Trust can help, as trust makes a team fast. We need to make trust the foundation of DevOps.
DevOps requires a cultural change. But how can a DevOps transformation work (esp. in large enterprises)? Observing many teams at several occasions, Dirk noticed that trust can be seen as the foundation of DevOps.</description>

      <description>As a developer, I always thought that security, like documentation, would be done by someone else. While that might have been true in the past, in today’s world that model no longer works. As a developer you’re responsible for the security of your app. Security in this case should be seen in the broadest sense of the word, ranging from licenses to software packages. A chef creating cheesecake has similar challenges.</description>

Projetos indispensáveis para o funcionamento do Kubernetes como ETCD e CNI são considerados como Incubating. pela CNCF. Não é só isso: quem usa está acostumado a passar versões usando seus recursos em apis beta.
Um dos recursos considerados por muitos essenciais para a integração de aplicações com o mundo são os objetos do tipo Ingress, atualmente em v1beta1.</description>

      <description>It is around 16:00 on a Friday afternoon and somebody from the other end of the office says out loud: “Who is working on fixing the API tests?” A silence, as thick as a morning fog, covers the entire floor. Nobody has done anything. Slowly, all eyes are turn towards the tester. How could she allow this to happen? When the API tests fail, the deployment pipeline is broken. When the pipeline is broken, there can be no deployment to production.</description>

Nessa palestra irei apresentar um projeto em que atuei como consultor - e que envolveu times em 5 países - onde, com foco na melhoria da organização dos repositórios e do fluxo entre os times, tive a oportunidade de ajudar a melhorar o desenvolvimento de código de gerência de configuração através de automações, utilizando as melhores práticas do Puppet e do GitLab, e baseado nos princípios da cultura DevOps.</description>

Equipamentos de alto custo operacional como máquinas de produção de papel emitem dados para que decisões sobre produtividade e problemas também possam ser tomadas.
Nesta palestra, apresentamos um case de como implementar uma Arquitetura Data-Driven baseado em Apache Kafka, as lições aprendidas e alguns problemas que enfrentamos ao adotar o ecossistema Apache Kafka incluindo brokers, workers com Kafka Connect e o Schema Registry além de aspectos de Observabilidade com o Elasticsearch.</description>

      <description>Pensar em qualidade é refletir sobre todo o processo de software, e a implementação do código é so uma parte disso. Depois de passar por situações e experiências que me ensinaram o que não fazer, aqui vão algumas sugestões para evitar dores de cabeça. A proposta é falar de testes, débito técnico, entregas contínuas, e algumas ferramentas que podem nos ajudar nisso. Além de refletir sobre o que o software produzido pode nos dizer sobre como as empresas funcionam, e o preço que se paga por não querer discutir qualidade.</description>

      <description>By now we’re all doing “the DevOps”, but what happens when things start to go off the rails? Have you taken a wrong turn in your implementation? How will you even know if a wrong turn was taken? During this talk, I would like to share three key areas; tool creep, top-down and directive DevOps, and aversion to standards, where a DevOps implementation can go off the rails. I also intend to discuss how you, the DevOps practitioner, can use your unique role, experience, and expertise to aid in keeping your organization on a healthy, paved DevOps path.</description>

      <description>KEYNOTE TALK ABSTRACT We overload our terms a lot in this industry. &amp;ldquo;Coupling&amp;rdquo; is one such. That word covers situations ranging from essential to accidental to comical to cosmic. Coupling seems to be the root of all ills. It is the molasses that slows our every move. And yet, in the industry from which we borrowed the term, &amp;ldquo;coupling&amp;rdquo; was not a dirty word. It meant something ingenious. Let us contemplate coupling for a time and see what we can do about it.</description>

      <description>There were significant changes in the Jenkins project over last year. It is still one of the most popular automation servers in the world, but it is not just a “server” anymore. In 2019 Jenkins is a universal automation engine, which actively evolves towards the new Cloud Native architecture and which can be used in any CI/CD flows. It can be used not only as a server, but also as a “serverless” single-shot execution.</description>

      <description>TALK ABSTRACT Risk quantification can be a valuable tool for selling transformation to executives. It’s also important to understand how your company looks at risk. Most CEOs will have a certain amount of risk they’re willing to take called their risk tolerance. This will help you to understand if your project is worth pursuing. If your project won’t offset more risk than the risk tolerance, then it’s unlikely to be funded if it’s not a new feature or product.</description>

      <description>Come and meet the story behind a unicorn’s on-call program. Almost three years ago we didn’t have a structured program to support on-call engineers… and with the scaling of the engineering team it was pretty clear that we needed something in place. We went from zero to have software engineers on-call and now we even have a 2.0 version of the program. Join me travelling through time and get a grasp about how it was to create a on-call program from scratch and the pitfalls that we faced.</description>

      <description>As more companies become comfortable with the cultural shift towards DevOps, or at least comfortable with the benefits they see others getting from the shift, application engineers are increasingly finding themselves responsible for the infrastructure their applications run on. This responsibility often ends up in the form of a config file that describes their infrastructure and is rarely changed and even more rarely understood. In this talk we&amp;rsquo;ll look at how teams that release application changes several times a day still struggle apply the same principles to their infrastructure code and how we can use modern tooling to apply well-known testing processes to infrastructure changes.</description>

      <description>When looking at the principles and practices of DevOps as well as the opportunity of adopting Serverless, we can be left thinking if these two approaches to delivering software compatible? The original premise of DevOps was to bring developers and operations closer together. Serverless architectures attempt to remove the operational burden as much as possible. Framed this way, you’d think they were incompatible, but DevOps has come along way since those early beginnings.</description>

      <description>In a manual testing scenario often times software releases are delayed due to new defects being discovered late in the lifecycle. Also, the amount of time it takes to manually test a regression suite is not effective. This is a story of how a team of manual quality assurance analysts embraced test automation tooling to gain early feedback in identifying defects sooner in the software releases.</description>

So much so, we probably spend a great deal of energy learning how to learn, learning how to retain, learning how to apply, learning how to be efficient, that learning how to be with each other gets lost in the mess. Straight to the point: Computer programmer. Software developer. Production Engineer.

      <description>Devices on the edge are hard to update. The process is often clunky, slow, and inconvenient. So what’s making them harder to deal with than other machines, and how do we design a system that mitigates the problem when we’re dealing with such a wide range of hardware configurations and capabilities?
There is no one-size-fits-all solution (yet!), but we do have some tools and techniques at our disposal that make the process a lot less painful and a lot more safe.</description>

      <description>Women often lack the confidence needed to take a new role if they do not meet all of the qualifications. We are starting to see the rapid rate of technological change play a role in who is considered for opportunities and who is not. In the upcoming years, more and more jobs will be displaced due to this change. We must redefine how we approach upskilling and reskilling, and find ways to meet individuals where they are at in order to see successful learning outcomes.</description>

      <description>In the world of Agile and DevOps we use many figures, charts and diagrams to argue and reason about our world and how we prioritize and make choices. You can&amp;rsquo;t say Agile without having drawn at least a few quadrants with axes scaling from &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; or from &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;could have been better&amp;rdquo;.
Unfortunately many of these important visualizations are misunderstood at best and abused at worst. We go through coming figures and check our cognitive biases.</description>

      <title>Using ChatOps Bots to Drive Practice Adoption</title>

      <description>Complex DevOps practices that involve communication around highly technical work are often developed ad hoc. Technical workers don’t usually have time to leverage the experience of other technical teams and a large pool of academic research that could provide guidance. Is it possible to use ChatOps bots to make it easier to adopt industry best practices?
This ignite talk will look at a few examples of how we are building chat bots within IBM to enable a smooth adoption of modern DevOps practices.</description>

      <title>Using Coaching Skills to Grow Compassion, Empathy and Kindness in DevOps</title>

      <description>An increasing number of people within tech are talking about compassion, empathy and kindness as being necessary to build great DevOps teams and solutions - and yet not everyone seems to view these as things that can be learned or taught. As a discipline, coaching uses all three to great advantage - and the good news is that basic coaching skills can be learned by anyone. Not only that, but they can be applied to a wide variety of contexts.</description>

      <description>I wish adopting DevOps was as easy as just ticking items off on a DevOps todo list. Or as easy as setting up Jenkins and Docker. The reality is very different. Successful DevOps transitions require changes in the technical stack, in the mindset, in practices, and in the organizational culture. Unfortunately, the key cultural elements that need to change are usually buried in apathy, shyness and office politics.
To reveal these crucial yet hidden cultural elements, we borrowed methods from an unlikely discipline: Design.</description>

      <description>This talk will do a brief walkthrough of what has been seen in enterprise shops around monitoring and DevOps. Then we will dive into talking about how we can use monitoring to turbocharge our DevOps journey. Some questions that will be answered:
Why is monitoring so critical to a DevOps journey? What are the critical metrics we should be looking for? How to translate what you’re seeing in the environment to CEO speak?</description>

      <description>100% uptime for a service is unrealistic, with the cost of marginal improvements becoming exponentially costly. This talk will highlight how Google Cloud uses SLOs and Error Budgets to provide uptime guarantees for our external customers, while also being able to aggressively launch new products/features and remain cost competitive at scale.
Google SRE uses the notion of a Service Level Objective (SLO) to define how fast/reliable/available a service needs to be.</description>

      <description>Terraform is a widely popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows infrastructure resources to be provisioned in minutes using code. That popularity poses a risk for those new to Terraform. This talk walks through some common security risks when using Terraform.
The goal of the presentation is to look at the risks of using Terraform in an unsafe manner and how to use it in a secure manner. The talk will walk through some of the following areas.</description>

      <description>While we’re fighting for our security and privacy, some are being left behind. Our current advice for securing our digital lives assume that the user is able to take control of their own own lives and are permitted to keep certain facts secret in order to authenticate to a service or device. For those whose threat models include former or current intimate partners their proximity to their attacker means that many security solutions are ineffective and, in some cases, even harmful to implement.</description>

      <description>The work we do is part of a larger system with a goal of ultimately delivering value to a person. Understanding how all of those pieces fit together helps us make better decisions on where to improve. If we automate the infrastructure creation to on demand, but any database changes take weeks, making the infrastructure faster doesn&amp;rsquo;t help.
In this workshop, we will go through simple ways to start your mapping your value stream.</description>

      <description>The DevOps Handbook clearly starts with the concept of value streams and DevOps Flow but it&amp;rsquo;s seldom mentioned when we dive into culture and automation. In this talk we go through the process of value stream mapping to identify where our pipeline is the most stuck and improvements are most needed.</description>

As she’s taught herself web development, she’s brought her research approach from her time at NASA-JPL &amp;amp; MIT into whatever she was learning. She loves exploring the web and teaching, and recently co-taught a PyCon tutorial on using web-scraping and modeling to predict Oscar winners. When she isn’t learning how the web can be better for developers, she enjoys blogging, nerding out about documentation, and snuggling as many cats as possible.</description>

      <description>Siempre me ha gustado trabajar en equipo y fomentar un buen ambiente de trabajo. Soy de las personas que piensan que pasamos una gran parte del día en la oficina y debemos aprovecharlo para crecer tanto a nivel profesional como personal. Esto lo podemos conseguir con buenas prácticas y mucha comunicación. Desde que descubrí el mindset agile no dejo de intentar aplicarlo siempre que puedo y transmitirlo a todo aquel que se cruce en mi camino.</description>

      <description>In the modern day SDDC, the ability to create a VM or template consistent, repeatable, and streamlined is a requirement. Using open source projects like Packer, Ansible, and InSpec you can build this nirvana. Using Packer to create a template, Ansible to do your configuration management, and then trigger InSpec scanning of your compliance policies all on vSphere. In this talk, we will walk through the required foundational knowledge to build this pipeline.</description>

      <description>Alors que tout le monde déploie en continue des applications sur Kubernetes, revenons sur l&amp;rsquo;expérience du déploiement de notre application, des prémices de Docker à aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui.
Pour déployer notre produit et proposer une offre SaaS, nous avons très tôt vu les avantages de la containerisation, mais nous avions beaucoup à apprendre: comment gèrer, déployer et maintenir en condition nos environnements? Quelles erreurs avons-nous fait? Pourquoi? Comment ne pas les reproduire?</description>

      <description>The main premise of this talk is that the current state of DevOps tooling, is overly complex and too much of a cognitive load to be sustainable given current demands. I will provide a history of how we got here, and the rationale behind the choices that resulted in our current state. Then we will look at the future, and the needs of modern software development which conflict with our current practices.</description>

      <description>I have given many talks about DevOps, but I realised, that I had always had the most focus on the Dev in DevOps. In this talk I&amp;rsquo;ll try to the best of my ability to remedy that, and talk about the more Ops&amp;rsquo;y things we&amp;rsquo;ve had practical experiences with in a DevOps setting. For example: Have you considered that there might be inherent security risks looming if you implement a microservices architecture?</description>

      <description>In this speech I’ll explain why it’s more important to focus on DevOps in cultural aspect, rather than a way to deploy cutting edge technology stack. We’ll look on following topics:
 History: why so many companies followed for DevOps buzzword and why DevOps is inherent part of product development. Standards: how to find out state of DevOps in your company and why you will not get particular answer on this question.</description>

      <title>We Are All Equifax: The Data Behind DevSecOps</title>

      <description>In 2017, hackers took three days to identify and exploit a new vulnerability in Equifax’s web applications. In the post-Equifax world, moving new business requirements (e.g., a non-vulnerable version of Struts2) into production in under three days might just be the new normal for your CI/CD pipeline. Join this session to better understand how DevSecOps teams are applying lessons from W. Edwards Deming (circa 1982), Eli Goldratt (circa 1984) and Gene Kim (circa 2013) to improve their ability to respond to new business requirements and cyber risks.</description>

      <description>For the last three years we have been taking part in a large-scale IT project at a corporate enterprise in Germany that was meant to be the first venture tackling all the latest buzz in the IT world including most prominently DevOps and continuous deployment in order to achieve a minimal time-to-market. Among the others are Agile, microservices, “the cloud”, and more. During this time we saw the project grow from 50 people in 6 teams to almost 500 in 40 teams and back to 150.</description>

      <description>Software used to be something that you walked into a Babbage’s store in the mall and bought in a box. That’s clearly no longer the case. The tech industry’s products and services have grown massively in scale and complexity since that time, and we’re now at a point where no one person can truly understand the systems we’re building entirely. Let’s actually take a look at what we can learn from the academic field of complexity theory: what are the essential characteristics of “complex systems”, and what changes do they imply we need to make in our approach to building and delivering the software systems of today?</description>

      <description>10 years ago, the very first devopsdays got organised in Ghent
10 years ago, nobody used the word devops
This small event changed many lives
It changed many organizations
After 10 years it is time to come back to where we started the movement
Time to come back to Ghent and reflect on our journey
Time to look back and forward.
Mine Heck &amp;amp; Yvo van Doorn kick off this special gathering as the MCs for DevOpsDays Ghent 2019!</description>

      <description>In early 2020 a global pandemic set in motion events which none of us could predict. For us at CircleCI, data from 900k+ devs, 25K orgs, and 30m+ builds/mo provided us some interesting insights into better DevOps practices. In this session, we will seek to uncover what this unique dataset can tell us about high-performing engineering teams, and what trends stand out through the aggregated platform usage.</description>

      <description>After 7 years of working in different corporate settings as a software engineer, I thought I had a good picture of what DevOps looked like. Then I joined TractorZoom. Over the last 6 months I have learned more about DevOps and tech debt than I knew before I started.
In this talk I’ll share the lessons I’ve learned at a startup about how we overcame a mountain of tech debt to stabilize our platform and accelerate our ability to deliver features to our customers and how you can translate that to your enterprise’s challenges.</description>

      <description>United Flight 232 should have crashed with 296 lives lost. In contrast, Asiana Flight 214 should not have crashed at all. The critical difference between the two was the interactions of their respective aircrews. Aircrew resource management refers to how cockpit crew members work together to make flights as safe and efficient as possible. These principles have been applied to other professional fields, and should be a central practice of every DevOps team.</description>

      <description>Automation and collaboration are key elements to successful DevOps. Cultural change being the most important tool in your toolkit, but we all know that technology that supports teams to work collaboratively and to automate everything support the cultural change and the ways of working necessary for successful DevOps.
We already have CI/CD tooling and container technology so what’s next? Have you heard about Kubernetes operators? You may have heard people mentioning them, you may have heard people talk about how significant they will be in the next wave of growth in container workload management - but why and what does that mean for DevOps - just another flash in the pan or are these operator thingys really going to change the landscape and excel us into productive, collaborative teams that delivery value more readily and more easily for our business and customers.</description>

      <description>As technologists we know that the only constant is change. We are all also familiar with the rate of change, how quickly trends can come and go, and how difficult it can be to know which ones might stick.
Wardley mapping can help us make sense of this. It is a technique for developing situational awareness in a landscape buffeted by the forces of competition and evolution. Maps are not silver bullets; they don’t predict the future.</description>

We provide low-level message-passing service for lots of customers within Facebook at planet-scale.
As a Production Engineers we support the whole lifecycle of our service, create automation solutions for it and sometimes fix incidents on the fly.
I&amp;rsquo;ll tell how do we work in general, what are our relationships to Software Engineers, what tools do we use in every-day work and what kind of automation we create and support.</description>

      <description>Our team is building a platform for Software and Infrastructure as a Service fully based on Open Source. We develop the platform, support our products, and be on call as well. When i started working on that team, i had no idea about DevOps or what it&amp;rsquo;s about. Especially what all this means in, at least my, reality? What does DevOps mean to &amp;ldquo;new” ones in our industry?
This ignite is a shot summary about how I see DevOps after being part of a team for over two and half years and especially what some DevOps ideas mean to us as a team and a company.</description>

      <description>In 2015 the viral internet moment of &amp;ldquo;The Dress&amp;rdquo; occurred that completely changed what I knew about deploying production web servers. As the on-call resource over the evening I saw web traffic that peaked at 670,000 active visitors on BuzzFeed.com. In this talk, I share lessons on the moment.
After a day of managing a physical datacenter build and dealing with a bunch of llamas getting loose in Los Angeles, I came home to what I hoped was an average evening.</description>

      <description>In 2015 the viral internet moment of “The Dress” occurred that completely changed what I knew about deploying production web servers. As the on-call resource over the evening I saw web traffic that peaked at 670,000 active visitors on BuzzFeed.com. In this talk, I share lessons on the moment.
After a day of managing a physical datacenter build and dealing with a bunch of llamas getting loose in Los Angeles, I came home to what I hoped was an average evening.</description>

      <description>Introducing DevOps in a large enterprise is difficult. But wait – why do we want to introduce DevOps in the first place? Good question. I will answer the question in my ignite talk and show you what happens when you introduce DevOps and what did not happen.</description>

      <description>What makes for a good application of machine learning? This is a discussion of the various factors that come in to play while making the decision to incorporate machine learning into a task. Some factors include (but are not limited to)
 The current status of an application (i.e. does an application to accomplish this task already exist?) The task to which machine learning will be applied The current state/capabilities/limitation of machine learning technologies (in general - not specific technology stacks) Examples of machine learning tasks and what results a user can expect  </description>

      <description>A wise person once said &amp;ldquo;Automate as much as you can&amp;rdquo;. While this seems like an obvious statement at first blush, on further consideration there are a number of exceptions to this rule. This begs the question: What shouldn&amp;rsquo;t I automate? When automation seems like the obvious choice, it may be because we&amp;rsquo;re blind to the consequences or cost of that automation. This talk will give you a framework for deciding if you should automate a task.</description>

      <description>Helm é a ferramenta padrão para gerenciamento de pacotes no Kubernetes. Certamente, razões não faltam! Através de seus Charts, por exemplo, Helm oferece um modo simples e prático para configurar e instalar aplicações complexas em nossos clusters.
Contudo, o que acontece quando as coisas dão errado?
Nessa apresentação curta e divertida vou explorar algumas peculiaridades - para não dizer idiossincrasias - da ferramenta Helm, do tipo que você só aprende ao gerenciar centenas de releases em produção.</description>

      <description>Cloud platforms provide a wealth of benefits for the organizations that use them. There’s no denying, however, that adopting the cloud can put strains on DevOps teams. Developers must use microservices to architect for portability, meanwhile operators are managing extremely large hybrid and multi-cloud deployments.
A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for making service-to-service communication safe, fast, and reliable. If you’re building a cloud native application, you need a service mesh.</description>

      <description>You’re at happy hour, maybe two or three glasses of wine into things; suddenly, you get a call from your customer. A hurricane, thousands of miles from where you are, hit your primary data center. Your customer begins to panic because your platform, which is needed for national security, is down.
How do you plan for something like this? We’ll walk through why a disaster recovery and contingency plan for platforms is necessary, what a successful contingency process looks, and most importantly, how you can incorporate a contingency plan into your processes.</description>

      <description>Some people say that the best thing you can do to test your knowledge of a topic is to explain it to someone else; so it follows that when people take the time to review others’ work, they often learn more than what they would’ve learned otherwise. Recently, I felt a similar experience in which I was asked to review a college student’s senior capstone project, which happened to focus on DevOps.</description>

I would argue that DevOps is on its way to oblivion For that, I would use theory from Water Benjamin, a Berliner thinker who lived in the early 20th century.
In more than 20 years in the field, I have seen many companies, technologies and professions come and go.</description>

      <description>Our end users are our co-workers. Seeing immediate results of our efforts is gratifying. But since they can find us with a quick Slack DM or in our office, it’s easy to fall into a cycle of requests for help and new requirements. How do we get our work done while also keeping users happy?
The modern worker’s productivity is besieged by constant interruptions. With DevOps end users often being the developer you chat with over coffee or who sends adorable cat GIFs via Slack, you might feel obligated to respond to their requests for help and enhancements in whatever tool/framework/component you own and that their work relies on.</description>

      <description>Let’s face it, managing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) access keys is a chore, even with a single application. Where are you storing your access keys? What is their rotation policy? Is your application currently using expired keys? And that’s just for one application. Pile on Kubernetes and application multi-tenancy, and you run into a key management nightmare! Enter KIAM, an open-source Kubernetes solution for granting application pods the ability to assume IAM roles, without the use of access keys.</description>

      <description>One of the most difficult questions that teams need to answer is: “Why are we doing x when we could be doing y?” Tooling and process decisions are highly influential, often come with a high degree of user bias, and yet can be among the worst documented decisions that organizations make.

However this highlights the point that we still lack the deeper understanding of the problem, and that is where design thinking can supercharge your focus. The design thinking framework can encourage you to start with the user and work backwards.</description>

      <title>Why Events &amp; People Matter: How the new girl used devopsdays to bring the fun to her workplace.</title>

      <description>What do you do when you’re the newest, last girl standing, and the future of an event series depends on you? At the top of 2019, I was a 6 month old contractor at Verizon with no idea what I was in for. I was content to do commendable work in the background - using my voice to write for our engineer-facing website. I’d get to know our engineers in interviews as they returned from industry conferences.</description>

      <description>One of my development projects made me uncomfortably aware that I will retire around year 2059. The world is going to be a different place then and we need to do more than just invest in our 401Ks for a secure retirement. This IGNITE talk will cover why I quit my job at a financial services company and what I am doing now at a nonprofit in Detroit.</description>

      <description>In tech, the understanding of concepts such as devops, agile and continuous integration can vary widely between individuals. This happens even when the concept has a public definition put out into the world. We hear these words and concepts at conferences and on podcasts; we read them in blogs and books; we teach them to our colleagues. We do all of this and inevitably we find out that those same people think of these concepts in different ways than we do.</description>

      <description>Two years ago, I presented an ignite talk at DevOpsDays DC on Diversity and Inclusion in Technology. You might remember my thesis: “Diversity is being invited to the party; Inclusion is being invited to dance.”
This talk inspired a conversation at my company about how we could ensure we have, and maintain, a diverse and inclusive environment in our own space. This then turned into a larger discussion about ensuring all employees within our company have a voice and an avenue to share new ideas, thoughts, and to provide feedback.</description>

But I am still learning, there is no end it seems.</description>

      <description>There are many different viewpoints when it comes to developing code. However, most companies can agree on time to market and quality code as two of the most important aspects of development. To expedite time to market, many companies build CI CD pipelines to automate the build integrate and deploy processes. But, what about quality code? How can companies ensure quality is included throughout their CI CD pipeline? One way to address this challenge is to optimize the quality stages of the CI CD pipeline.</description>

In this Workshop, you will learn to use the basics of Value Stream Mapping. You will analyze one of your own Value Streams, understand its shortcomings, and identify how DevOps can help.</description>

      <description>Audiences interested in learning about the “Three Ways” and the application of the C.A.L.M.S principles to the way they work together can explore basic DevOps concepts in the business simulation “The Phoenix Project” created by GamingWorks BV. It is loosely based on the story of the eponymous novel by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr an George Spafford. Like the characters in the book, participants work together to meet a big, hairy and audacious goal: Successfully finish the troubled “Phoenix Project” and turn around the bad financial situation of the fictional company “Parts Unlimited” within only 90 days.</description>

      <description>This talk presents multiple approaches and patterns with their advantages and disadvantages, so you can pick the one that fits your organization best:
 Parse: Take the log files of your applications and extract the relevant pieces of information. Send: Add a log appender to send out your events directly without persisting them to a log file. Structure: Write your events in a structured file, which you can then centralize. Containerize: Keep track of short lived containers and configure their logging correctly.</description>

      <description>In the last years we have seen the rise of microservices, containers, orchestrators and lately service meshes as well.
A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication, responsible for a reliable delivery of requests through the complex topology of a microservices architecture, without the single applications needing to be aware. The concept of the service mesh as a separate layer is tied to the rise of the cloud-native applications.</description>

      <description>Day 2 Kubernetes is where things start to get tricky and observability is extremely important to anyone building things outside of localhost. Teams spend many sprints researching and comparing different monitoring and logging tools. The goal here is demystification to help those folks reach a decision quicker that they feel more confident in. By showcasing an entire insight stack deployed into a fresh cluster we can help jumpstart their journey.</description>

      <description>More and more teams are looking for ways to iterate gradually and validate their ideas with data. Techniques like A/B testing, feature flagging, and gradual rollouts are quickly going from niche to mainstream. More experimentation means faster development and better products. But like any trend, product experimentation is a good idea that can easily go wrong. For every game-changing A/B test, there’s a trail of testing mistakes that led well-meaning teams down the wrong path.</description>

      <description>Fear not… whatever you can do by using Infrastructure as Code can be done by hand through a GUI, given enough time… but there are probably better things to spend time on. There is plenty Infrastructure as Code solutions out there, but there’s a relatively „new kid on the block“ that plays extremely well with serverless and allows you to perform wonders in minutes/hours rather than days. Please welcome Pulumi. Serverless stuff is charged per usage so there’s no penalty if you’ve deployed five function apps instead of just one.</description>

It’s a fully interactive session where a series of (deceptively simple) concepts are presented, then we all work through the difficult parts together, with most or all of the ideas coming from the attendees themselves. Towards the second half of the session, we’ll break into small group to work on specific, concrete goals, such drafting a proposal, practising a pitch, and so forth.</description>

      <title>Workshop: Recipes to embed security in your testing methodology</title>

      <description>Security is becoming an increasingly important concern during the lifecycle of developing application especially for those using the concept of fast (and furious) continuous delivery, and frequent release cycle. In this training, participants will learn who to easily configure/map security tools to their existing DevOps toolchain, and how to automate this process using cloud-infrastructure automation tools. The aim is to introduce security controls at the early stage of software development (controls while the developer is coding in his own machine), and before pushing code to the mutualized code repo (version control tool), and finally before (and after) deploying code to the production environment.</description>

      <description>The world is changing. You went away from waterfall and plan-driven development to doing agile. But why does agile not work? Why are you not faster and better and happier? You installed Scrum Masters, you have boards for Transparency, you have a Definition Of Done and you use Story Points. But did you really change your way of working? If a team believes they are agile, but nothing has changed about the way they test, they are probably not there yet.</description>

We dive into some common errors people encounter when working with YAML. These seem to be commonly accepted, which might be a form of the Stockholm Syndrome. And we are also taking a quick look at alternative formats and what they do (not) have to offer.</description>

It could be DevOps or a new tool, but you always get an excuse why &amp;ldquo;That won&amp;rsquo;t work here&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t have time&amp;rdquo;. Lets explore the ways people make these excuses, and then some ways to overcome them. All while having a little fun!</description>

      <description>As the DevOps movement continues to see momentum, many organizations still don’t know where to start. A common misconception is tooling will make you “DevOps”, while tools can give you software that will allow you to automate or continuously deliver or monitor, alone they won’t get you to necessary processes to take advantage of the benefits DevOps has to offer. In this talk attendees will learn why it’s the people that matter most and how to leverage DevOps best practices along with processes to make the most out of your DevOps journey.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been running Kubernetes in production for 2 years, and have worked on enterprise Kubernetes service teams including Heptio Kubernetes, and Azure managed Kubernetes team. This presentation is very special and will talk about the dangers in using Kubernetes incorrectly. This presentation is drawn on years of real experience reports of providing Kubernetes as a service. We learn about the surprising ways users have used/abused Kubernetes, and how their creative use cases ended up causing catastrophic problems for the rest of the system.</description>

      <description>As the DevOps movement continues to see momentum many organizations don’t know where to start. A common misconception is tooling will make you “DevOps”. While tools can give you the software that will allow you to automate, continuously deliver, monitor, and more; alone they won&amp;rsquo;t get you to the necessary practices to take advantage of the benefits DevOps has to offer. In this talk attendees will learn why it’s the people and culture that matter most and how to leverage DevOps best practices along with processes to make the most out of your DevOps journey.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes is a great piece of technology. It is probably the de-facto container orchestrator for most people using container orchestrators. There is a huge demand for it as well as a lot of interest from businesses to move to Kubernetes.
Like anything that is new and hip, there will always be more want for something than there is need for it. Kubernetes is no different. Everyone “wants” the new cool thing.</description>

      <description>It’s important to recognize not everyone can take on chaotic engineering, there are multiple factors that we have to take into consideration. production is extremely complex and we don’t always know how to untangle it. This talk will walk you through getting to a steady state, it will show attendees how to process map and prioritize systems issues as a team and then develop them into stand alone projects to get your environment to a steady state that can properly handle chaotic engineering.</description>

My objective is to change the perspective of the DevOps community in London and encourage more engineers to look at mainframes as a viable career alternative. Or, at least remove the negative bias that I have seen towards the mainframe stack. Consider the fact that all 25 of the world&amp;rsquo;s top banks still use mainframes.</description>

Being able to transform a junior engineer into an excellent mid, then senior engineer is a competitive advantage for any company.

      <description>Kubernetes allows a lot. After discovering its features, it’s easy to think it can magically transform your application deployment process into a painless no-event. For Hello World applications, that is the case. Unfortunately, not many of us do deploy such applications day-to-day.
You need to think about application backward compatibility, possible rollback, database schema migration, etc. I believe the later is one of the biggest pain point. In this talk, I’ll demo how to update a Spring Boot app deployed on a Kubernetes cluster with a non-trivial database schema migration with the help of Flyway, while keeping the service up during the entire update process.</description>

      <description>With the rapid pace of technology, it’s easy for anyone or any team to quickly fall behind the latest tech trends. However, falling years behind is a completely different story, and can feel like an insurmountable challenge to overcome knowing you can’t put your business on hold. In this presentation, Mike will cover cultural and technological issues that can hold a system/team/company behind. He will present ideas on how you can start incrementally adopting modern and healthy practices such as DevOps, automated testing, and upgrading to newer platforms.</description>

      <description>Descrever como lidamos com os testes de uma aplicação que originalmente poderia ser vista como uma caixa preta, mas com a sua fragmentação em micro-serviços isso se transformou em várias caixas menores. O foco é demonstrar como docker e kubernetes nos auxiliou a montar e arrumar os testes para garantir o funcionamento de cada um dos micro-serviços e da aplicação como um todo.</description>

      <title>“I’m not technical” and other lies (ballroom)</title>

      <description>Documentation should come from a place of empathy - easing someone else’s journey can enable them to do even more innovation. Documentation requires feedback and requires humility. I used to be one of those women who said “but I’m not technical.” Even after I had created technical marketing materials and guides and lead the third largest user group for AWS in North America. Done well, documentation lowers the barriers for others, foster open collaboration, and create adaptive guides for everything from process to product.</description>
