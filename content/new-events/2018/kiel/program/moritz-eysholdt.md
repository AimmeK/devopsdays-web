In this presentation I will briefly describe the advantages a Cloud IDE can have over a traditional text editor or IDE that runs on the desktop: Tighter integration with services, runtimes, testing environments. Zero setup time, friction-less collaboration and much more. Then I will continue to compare the currently available Cloud IDEs: Amazons Cloud 9, Eclipse Che, Eclipse Orion, Theia, etc. I will highlight theirs strengths and weaknesses and point out in which scenarios they are applicable.
