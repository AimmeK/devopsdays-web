As a Mathematician and Statistician, he always enjoyed data modelling, predicting, data sharding algorithms and implementing data products. He worries about the Ops part of AI, joined the devops community (organiser of devopsdays Amsterdam) & co-founded itnext.io. Excited about the business implications of his IT endeavours and instigated by "The Goal" by Eliyahu Goldratt, Thiago is always looking for actual consequences of his products & diminishing time-to-market.
