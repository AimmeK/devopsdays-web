While studying IT Systems Engineering at Hasso Plattner Insitute in Potsdam, I started working as a research engineer in 2009. After finishing my master’s degree in 2011, I became a software developer, which served as a springboard for me to pursue my interest in testing in 2012. As a system engineer, I gained expertise in test automation and its integration into agile processes. My focus today is on making developers’ lives easier by providing smart solutions for testing and test automation.
