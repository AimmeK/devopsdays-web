Andy is a Platform Engineer at Sky Betting and Gaming. He considers himself a Kubernetes and Hadoop fettler, spending a far too much of his spare time making Raspberry Pis do things they shouldn&#39;t. He was a small part of the organising team for DevOpsDays London 2018 and has been runing the Devops meetup in Leeds for 5 years hosting over 40 events. He&#39;s attended and spoke at a bunch of DevOps conferences and in his words is &#39;an all round DevOps nuisance&#39;.
