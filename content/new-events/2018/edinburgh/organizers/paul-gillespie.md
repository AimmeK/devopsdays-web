I am the Developer Enablement tribe lead at Skyscanner where I help guide a number of cross functional teams who work on enabling the product engineering organisation to design, develop and operate their services at scale across multiple AWS regions and data centers. Over the past 20 years I have worked in a diverse range of industries from power utilities, to mobile gaming (remember WAP?) to travel meta search. Early in my career I realized that I hated error prone, manual processes and decide that the world would be a better place with just a little bit more automation and more diverse teams. My interest include automation, distributed computing, micro-services, cloud computing, Web scale infrastructure, system architecture and blasting through the Scottish countryside on my bike!
