I am a senior developer at Epsagon, a startup focused on bringing observability to serverless cloud applications. I have a cyber-security background, with experience in reverse engineering, networks analysis and breaking things as a habit. Currently focused on using distributed tracing and AI technologies to tackle the unique observability challenges in serverless environments. Apart from that, I am a huge rock climbing enthusiast!
