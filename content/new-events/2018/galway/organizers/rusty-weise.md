Rusty&#39;s CV proudly states he is a Swiss Army Knife. He uprooted himself from
his home town of Portland, Oregon in 2015 to pursue a life goal of being an
ex-pat in Galway. Currently his days are spent on a monitoring and logging
solution in the Software Defined Cloud Group in Hewlett Packard Enterprise,
and volunteering. He fills every breath of spare time with learning the Celtic
harp, diligently studying Irish, being an apprentice potter, knitting, and
tinkering with his 1959 Austin Mini among many other activities.
