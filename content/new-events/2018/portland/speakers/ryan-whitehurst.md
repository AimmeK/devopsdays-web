Ryan works as a software engineer at Puppet, where he has worked for four years. Whether working as a developer, sysadmin, or both, he believes that every task we have to do is just something we haven't automated yet, and since people are really good at coming up with new, interesting problems to solve with technology, automating as much as we can is important to keeping up with an ever-changing world.
