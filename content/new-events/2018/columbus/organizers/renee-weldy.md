Renee’s been working in some part or another of IT for 27 years now.  She’s been a technical writer, a software instructor, a web application developer, a Remedy administrator, a business/system analyst, and a project manager – not necessarily in that order.  She’s fairly new to DevOps, but attending the 2016 DevOpsDays Ohio conference showed her that this is a culture she definitely wants to help promote and grow!
