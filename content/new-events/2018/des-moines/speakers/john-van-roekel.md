John’s not that great, he’s mostly here for the free food. John works with Matt doing .NET developer support, where he gets to help people find and understand tools that will help them develop software more quickly and efficiently. John is currently dipping his toes into DevOps and Cloud technologies, and learning how he can help others understand and put them to work.
