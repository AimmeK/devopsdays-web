"I'm a software developer that does a lot of infrastructure as I'm the technical lead of the infrastructure team of the Banno business unit of Jack Henry and Associates. 

Things I like: Kubernetes, Emacs, Basketball, Music, Bacon, my kids and wife. Not particularly in that order.

Things I don't like: BS, waiting, being cold, slow WiFi. "
