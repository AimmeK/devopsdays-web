DevOps principles are great, but when introduced into a legacy development process, this change can be tough.  However when working on projects with tight timelines or trying to catch up to a rapidly advancing market, it's important that these processes are put in place.  It's important that everyone is on the same page with these changes, and for non-technical team members, it can be difficult to quantify the benefits of DevOps culture. This can be frustrating for someone who's heard success stories and wants to implement it at their company. 

This talk will be a look at how we introduced a build system, updated version control practices and changed communication standards at a company with a previously-decade old toolset and mindset. We'll also examine how a fragile server provisioning and rigid deploys were transitioned to a more fluid DevOps model. This resulted in consistent environments and a modern developer toolset. Together, these changes resulted in greater development velocity and a much smoother process from ticket to deploy.
