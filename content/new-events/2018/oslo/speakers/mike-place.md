Mike Place is the project maintainer of Salt — one of the largest, most active open-source projects in the world. He also runs the engineering team at SaltStack — the company behind Salt and maker of other fine software products for managing systems at scale.

When he is not writing code, managing people or wondering how to make computers do his bidding, he enjoys trail running and skiing in the mountains behind his home in Salt Lake City, Utah.
