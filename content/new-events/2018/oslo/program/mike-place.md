As systems grow more and more complex, new patterns are emerging to manage and control modern infrastructure. In this talk, Mike Place -- the maintainer of the SaltStack project -- will provide an introduction to an event-driven approach for systems management, blending traditional monitoring and configuration management techniques together to show how to build resilient and autonomous systems that can achieve automation workflows sophisticated enough for the modern data center.
