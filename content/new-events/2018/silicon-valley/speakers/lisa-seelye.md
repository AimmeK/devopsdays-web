Lisa has been a systems administrator with FreshBooks for just over three years. Prior to that she was a sysadmin at a Toronto-based gaming company for seven years. Going back far enough Lisa made computers do things with Ruby and Rails. When she isn't at work you can probably find Lisa playing Magic, video games or listening to audiobooks. Ask her what she is currently reading!
