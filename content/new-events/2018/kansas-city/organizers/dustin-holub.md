Dustin is an outgoing individual who believes that work and fun can be one in the same. After spending many years of his career in infrastructure silos, he was drawn to the DevOps culture and its emphasis on learning and solving problems together. Dustin spends his free time with his wife chasing their two small children, playing indoor soccer, or wondering when technology will completely free him from housework.
