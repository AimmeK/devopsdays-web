Deployment Pipeline Craftsman always ready to learn new ways to implement Source Control, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery for databases, applications and infrastructure. Deployment pipeline is my favorite technical and cultural tool. I work as DevOps Coach at [Natixis](https://www.natixis.com/natixis/jcms) with automation, collaboration and communication as priorities. My background is in database administration with a special interest in database changes and data modeling.
