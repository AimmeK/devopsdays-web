**Anders is a Change and Configuration Management Expert at Systematic Software Engineering, which is based in Denmark.**

In my work I strive to enable people to achieve great results using efficient tooling that supports processes that consistently deliver in the organisation.

In my years with Systematic Iâ€™ve introduced and retired four different version control systems, two bug tracking systems, and a build server.  

My current interest is integrating support and developments respective needs, while always on the search for new tools to augment our build pipeline or upgrade existing.
