- Jack-of-all-trades, which is different from full-stack.
- Degree in biotech, past life in broadband engineering (and wine, cheese, A/V, suits...) I was a working adult for 10 years before IT.
- Only been working with computers professionally for 6 years: 4 in Problem and Incident Management, 2 in Sustaining Engineering.
- I dislike strict team definitions and work across a wide range of operational areas.
- Passionate about staffing, problem solving, and having a wide view.
- IT adrenaline junkie
- I commute 12 hours a week so I can live in the country with my alpacas and chickens.
