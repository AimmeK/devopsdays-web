<p>We fear robot overlords as we do vampires, werewolves, and other baddies that go bump in the night. We worry that their intelligence will take our jobs, our livelihood, our freedom, and enslave us to their bidding; or at least thatâ€™s how it happens in the movies. This talk addresses our relationship with computers as tools and how we should allow computers to do the work, so people can do the innovating. Talk by Christina Aldan, TEDx speaker, trainer, and digital advertising consultant whose boutique agency, LG Designs, offers businesses brand consulting and creative content for everyday media.</p>
