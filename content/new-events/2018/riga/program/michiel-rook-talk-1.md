<p>Does your application or service use a database? When that application changes because of new business requirements, you may need to make changes to the database schema. These database migrations could lead to downtime and can be an obstacle to implementing continuous delivery/deployment.</p>

<p>How can we deal with database migrations when we don’t want our end-users to experience downtime, and want to keep releasing?</p>

<p>In this talk we’ll discuss non-destructive changes, rollbacks, large data sets, useful tools and a few strategies to migrate our data safely, with minimum disruption to production.</p>
