<p>Build engineering is fun, especially with the awesome choice of tools we have today! In this showcase I’m building a build pipeline with TeamCity. You are going to learn why build pipelines are useful (yes, not only for the sake of eye candy!), and how the CI server can optimise when properly configured.</p>

<p>In this talk I’m going to start with the simple scenarios and gradually introduce the complexity: scaling the project by adding constraints and requirements. This will result in changing the build process and revealing the tips & tricks alongside.</p>
