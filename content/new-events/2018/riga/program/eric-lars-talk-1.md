<p>"Bonnier News is the largest news organisation in Sweden, publishing Dagens Nyheter and Expressen, two of the country’s largest newspapers. When we needed to build a new data processing platform that could accommodate the needs of many different, competing brands, we turned to Openshift and Kubernetes. In this presentation, we will describe the architectural tradeoffs and choices we made, and how we have been able to deploy data flows at a high rate by focusing on technical simplicity." Lars Albertsson is an independent consultant for Bonnier News as well as Spotify, several startups and banks. He will talk together with Eric Skoglund, the product owner of Bonnier News’s data platform project.</p>
