    <h2>About Washington, DC</h2>

    <p>
      If all you know of Washington, DC is what you see on C-SPAN or <em>House
      of Cards</em>, you are missing out. While its importance as the Nation's
      Capital and center of government is undisputed, the "DMV" (District,
      Maryland, and Virginia) is also home to innovative startups, leading
      universities, and world-class arts and culture.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are local, you already know the diversity of our DevOps community.
      If you are coming in from elsewhere, prepare to mix with DevOps leaders
      from every segment of our vibrant local scene. And, of course, take some
      time to check out everything else the Nation's Capital has to offer, from
      the many free Smithsonian museums to great food and drink!
