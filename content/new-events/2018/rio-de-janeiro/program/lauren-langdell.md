Diversity is more than a buzzword, it’s a movement.
Technological change and innovation continue as ‘tech’ is becoming integrated with every sector and industry.
Inclusivity and low participation of women in the tech space has long been a challenge locally and abroad.
Why diversity in tech? Not just because we believe representation to be fair and just, but because we believe that technology that is .created by people that accurately reflect society will result in better technology for all.
Diversity makes for an innovative, engaged and happy team – diverse talent pools allow stronger business results.
