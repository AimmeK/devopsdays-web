<br> <br> DevOpsDays is a conference for not only Developers and System/Operations Engineers, but everyone across the spectrum involved in creating or managing technical solutions in any industry. We are returning as alumni to last year's event location: [Plexpod: Westport Commons](https://goo.gl/maps/xCRAPmCQkD22). This historic junior high school provides the perfect ambiance to put you in a learning mindset and will help facilitate education and ideas around how to deliver faster, with better quality.

This conference is hosted by DevOpsKC, make sure to checkout our [monthly meetup](https://meetup.devopskc.com) and our [website](https://devopskc.com).

<b>Learning</b> <br> At DevOpsDays we discuss the culture and tools that can make organizations run better, deliver faster, and improve quality.  This year, we have a fantastic lineup of over 30 speakers and facilitators from around the country. There are 10 interactive workshops that will let you dive deeper into the domain of your choice. With a mix of in-depth talks, tech-focused workshops, and laser-focused Ignite talks, you are sure to learn something new!


<b>Sharing</b> <br> We've heightened focus on Open Spaces, a DevOpsDays staple, by removing conflicts from the schedule to ensure everyone can participate. These round-table discussions ensure attendees can contribute to topics in small discussions with other passionate collaborators. Space to break out and share success and failure, get feedback on creative solutions, and ask for help solving real-world problems, provides an immeasurable opportunity to grow yourself, and ultimately, your tech teams back at work.

<b>Fun</b>
<br>
• Don't miss the <a target="_blank" href= "/events/2019/kansas-city/social">Thursday evening networking social sponsored by New Context at No Other Pub!</a>
<br>
• Get excited about food from KC treats - Waypoint Coffee, Hurts Donuts, Joe's Kansas City Bar-B-Que, and Hawaiian Bros Island Grill.
<br>
• The Organizers and various Sponsors will be giving away a variety of prizes throughout the conference. Of course, you must be present to win.
<br>
• Do you fancy yourself as someone who can think on their toes? Then, Ignite Karaoke is for you, and everyone else, to enjoy.
