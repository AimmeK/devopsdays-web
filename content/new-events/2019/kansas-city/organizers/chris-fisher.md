Chris started her career as a high school history teacher. After transitioning to software training (where she was never required to call anyoneâ€™s parents!) she found her career path in technology. Currently managing a team of Business Analysts and Software Quality Engineers at the NAIC, she is passionate about ensuring that functional teams are just as much a part of the DevOps journey as the technical teams. Outside of work Chris enjoys spending time with her family and planning their next travel adventures.
