"Are you kidding? It's got fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles." This describes not only devops, but the greatest movie of all time, The Princess Bride. With those similarities, perhaps there are lessons that we can learn from this great movie.

Devops is the greatest thing in the world, except for a nice MLT - mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich where the mutton is nice and lean. However, we can still learn from things outside of devops. Need to see how people with cross-functional skills can overcome challenges they couldn't alone? Look no farther than Westley, Inigo and Fezzik storming Florin castle. This talk will use scenes, quotes and references from The Princess Bride to teach everyone things about devops.
