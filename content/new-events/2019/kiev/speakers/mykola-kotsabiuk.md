I am .Net Software Developer at 3Shape. Currently, we are building scanners and software for dentistry. I have strong interests in automation, infrastructure management and exploring ways to do it properly. I usually spend my time by sharing knowledge and discuss new trends in IT. Also, I often learn the details of the Microsoft development platform and frameworks.
