Thiago de Faria is the Head of Solutions Engineering at LINKIT, a knowledge-driven organization with IT experts supporting partners with a transparent path toward pain mitigation and solving business problems.

Passionate about data, programming and the people behind it, heâ€™s given many talks and workshops at conferences. Sometimes on stage, sometimes coding and sometimes in meetings, Thiago loves to learn and try new things... _he also likes to crack bad jokes that sounded better on his own mind_.

He is an active part of the community (_devops, ITNEXT & Codemotion_), married to someone smarter than him, open-source enthusiast, knowledge-sharer, and a proud father. Thiago wakes up every day with one goal: develop happy high-performing teams to decrease time-to-market and build production-ready applications, always!
