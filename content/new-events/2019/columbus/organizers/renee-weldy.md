Renee’s been working in some part or another of IT since 1989. She’s been a technical writer, a software instructor, a web application developer, a Remedy administrator, a business/system analyst, a project manager, and more – but not necessarily in that order. She attended the 2016 DevOpsDays Ohio conference and immediately volunteered to be an organizer for future conferences.  This is a culture she definitely wants to help promote and grow!
