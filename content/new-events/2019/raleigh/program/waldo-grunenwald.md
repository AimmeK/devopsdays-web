Have you ever gotten into an argument because the statement you made wasn’t understood as you intended? Have you ever seen a simple disagreement go rapidly off the rails, and turn into a shouting match?

Rather than quipping at one-another (like UDP), there is a technique for resolving disputes or conflicts that is more akin to TCP. It is called “Active Listening.” In this talk, I’ll show you how this technique reduces the likelihood of a shouting match by drastically slowing the escalation, and forcing each side to listen and comprehend what the other person is trying to say.
