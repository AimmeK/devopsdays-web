Containers took the world by storm and have changed the way we encapsulate our applications. Kubernetes took it a step further my standardizing distributed systems to manage and run containers. Along the way we lost touch with the power of virtualization. In this talk we look at a critical new hybrid system that spans virtual machines, virtual infrastructure, and container orchestration. We learn how this impacts real systems, data pipelines, and stateful applications.
