Istio is one of the most important things to happen to continuous delivery/deployment since Kubernetes. In this talk, you'll learn how to leverage Helm and Istio to create reliable automated deployment. To help us visualize the rollout we've built an interactive, open-source app and will ask audiences to help decide if a rollout continues or not.
