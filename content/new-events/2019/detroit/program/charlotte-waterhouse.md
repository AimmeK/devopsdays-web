One of my development projects made me uncomfortably aware that I will retire around year 2059. The world is going to be a different place then and we need to do more than just invest in our 401Ks for a secure retirement. This IGNITE talk will cover why I quit my job at a financial services company and what I am doing now at a nonprofit in Detroit.
