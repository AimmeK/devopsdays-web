Michael has worked in the New Zealand IT sector for over two decades, generally on small teams solving big problems. This has involved wearing many hats in addition to "software developer".

His experience working on software projects for brain injury rehabilitation and workplace wellness inspired him to study psychology at University.

He is intrigued about what happens when technology and culture meet at any level, from within a close-knit team, to events that effect society across the globe.

A devout practitioner of Agile and DevOps, he believes technology can (and should!) be used to benefit us all.
