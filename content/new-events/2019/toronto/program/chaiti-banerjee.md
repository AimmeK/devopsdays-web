The goal of delivery-transformation is to modernize both business and technology to create one fully enabled team, with one optimal end-to-end delivery model. Its business imperatives are to:

- increase the speed of delivering successful business outcomes
- lower the cost of delivery
- improve delivery predictability
- minimize response time to market

It is achievable by Devops-pipeline and integrating with other shift-left initiative like Continuous-Monitoring, Continuous-Testing.
