As security, reliability and continuous integration become more of a concern for organizations of all sizes, DevOps teams have to come up with ways to support these increasing workload demands. We all have many tedious, often toilsome, chores related to maintaining on our production environment(s). So, we automate the toil; now what do we do? We collaborate with other teams to help reduce their toil! That is, we scale the practice! In this presentation Jesse and Bozhidar from the Pivotal PWS Platform team in Toronto will define and discuss the properties of toil, present some of the toilsome tasks they've faced and describe practices around identifying and prioritizing ways to address toil within a team and the larger organization. They'll wrap up by talking about culture changes and team collaboration to better enable a more sustainable working model within the organization and broader community.
