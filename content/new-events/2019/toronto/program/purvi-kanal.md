Building Slackbots is really useful and extremely fun, but the development environments for Slackbots tend to be clunky or require setting up servers for really small applications. In this talk we'll go through setting up a Slackbot development workflow using the Serverless framework, with continuous deployments and hot reloading so that you can focus on the bot's functionality rather than all of the setup involved.
