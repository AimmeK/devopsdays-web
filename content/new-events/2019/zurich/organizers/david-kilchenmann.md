&lt;p&gt;David is product manager at Puzzle ITC, an open-source IT company based in Bern &amp; Zurich. He loves how the container technologies changed the way software is developed and run, but still sees a lot of potential within other organizations to adopt a DevOps mindset. At Puzzle he is working in the product management for several open source solutions like Hitobito, APPUiO, PuzzleTime &amp; Liima. Before Puzzle he was leading the Swisscom Software Day for two iterations and promoting the Swisscom software culture within the company.&lt;/p&gt;
