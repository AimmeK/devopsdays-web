&lt;p&gt;I am passionate about everything agile and human centered. Having started my career in an old school waterfall environment more than 20 years ago as a software engineer and project manager, I am now happy to enable teams and large organisations to establish agile methods and DevOps. I specifically like the combination (and challenges) of technical and cultural aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
