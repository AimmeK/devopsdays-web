Born and grown in the beautiful Sardinia in Italy, I moved to Zurich to complete my
studies at the ETH (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology).
After working on delay tolerant networks with Android devices I focused on
Web development and scalable, resilient software architectures on the cloud.
Currently working as a Freelancer for customers in Switzerland.
