Automation is my passion. In my current role at IPT I help our clients throughout their
DevOps journey combining my software development, operations and leadership skills
addressing the technological and cultural dimension of the transformation.

My career started as a software developer and for first 5 years I worked in several
companiesfocusing on agile principles, as well as Continuous Integration with a specific
focus on Test Driven Development.

For the next 10 years I lead different Development and Operations teams at Swisscom
where I gained experience in transforming Teams towards self-organization.
