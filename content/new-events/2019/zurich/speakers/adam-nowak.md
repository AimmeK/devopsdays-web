I&#39;m a dedicated, goal-driven individual, leveraging my experience to empower other fellow
professionals. Nothing makes me feel better than the success of my team! I like to keep
things clean and simple, starting from my todo list and ending with detailing cars!
About me: I work as a Software Development Practice Lead in Netguru and my job is to keep
improving processes around software we create. I also work closely with Engineering
Managers on day-to-day challenges involving company growth and ever-changing software
environment.
