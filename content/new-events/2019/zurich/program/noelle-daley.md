In today’s distributed world it is increasingly important to embrace some form of a
distributed workplace. Whether your team sits in the same room or in separate home offices
around the world, there are certain practices you can follow that not only make your team
more remote- friendly, but more inclusive, diverse and scalable. This talk takes a look at
the practices of thriving remote teams — specifically their adoption of a written
culture —  and highlights that these best practices are beneficial to all teams,
distributed or otherwise.
