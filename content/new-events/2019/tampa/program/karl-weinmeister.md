Kubeflow is an open-source project dedicated to making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. In this lightning talk, youâ€™ll learn about the problems Kubeflow solves and how it works.

In this talk, we will cover: * How end-to-end ML workflows require heavy lifting from DevOps * What are typical problems that Kubeflow solves * What are the main components of Kubeflow * How does Kubeflow interact with Kubernetes
