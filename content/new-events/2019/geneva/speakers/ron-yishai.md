I am a software engineer with an academic background in Mathematics, experienced in cyber-security, reverse engineering, machine learning - and recently also a Serverless enthusiast. During the last year, I am working as a senior developer on Epsagon - a startup focused on bringing observability to serverless cloud applications, using distributed tracing and AI technologies, tackling the unique challenges in such environments.
