### Prerequisite

Have a recent (v2.20.0 or greater) version of Git
(https://git-scm.com/downloads) already installed on your machine. If
you use Windows, make sure that you can use Git either from Git Bash
(that is part of Git for Windows), Windows Subsystem for Linux, a
Linux virtual machine, or cygwin, as you will need an sh compatible
shell.

### Objectives

This workshop is about learning some advanced Git commands and options
by trying and discussing them. You will also learn some performance
and workflow tips.
