##### KEYNOTE TALK ABSTRACT

What does it take to innovate quickly? I’ll address how blockers to innovation –  including culture, skills, antiquated processes, and board level concerns – can stand in the way of business agility. We’ll map out a pathway to digital transformation including new metrics for success, integrating real-world best practices from enterprises, and the most effective organizational patterns, as we integrate the business with development and operations.
