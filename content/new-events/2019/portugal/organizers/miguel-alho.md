Full-time, 14-years-in-the-making, software engineer with a DevOps and Craftsmanship mindset. Previously, I worked mainly as a dev freelancer, but also as a consultant, school teacher, media producer and project manager. I&#39;m a very big fan of TDD as a development practice, very fond of microservices, of automating as much as possible in the dev, build and deploy pipeline, but also in finding ways to augment individual and team learning experiences.
