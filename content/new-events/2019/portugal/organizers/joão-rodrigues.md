João Rodrigues started his career in 1999 as a C and C&#43;&#43; software developer. The first 8 years working for a large traditional multi-national gave him a deep waterfall practices knowledge. He leveraged this experience to better understand the benefits of the Agile Movement and how to break the wall between business and development to reduce the software cost creep. After 8 more years working as a software development consultant applying agile methodologies, João started his latest professional journey 3 years ago at OutSystems. His is now playing the role of DevOps Practice Lead focusing on delivering better low-code software faster.
