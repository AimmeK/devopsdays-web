I’m a software engineer, from head to toes! I&#39;m passionate about design practices, architecture, quality, code and efficiency. For me, there is nothing more satisfying that helping others to meet their goal. From small companies to enterprises companies, if there is a software challenge, you can count on me! Currently, I&#39;m at EDP to instantiate DevOps. An excellent challenge!
