    <p>If Open Space is new to you, you may be interested in <a href="/pages/open-space-format">more details about Open Space</a>.</p>
    <p>This year for the first half of open space time we'll be hosting a park bench panel. Listen in and participate in an engaging panel discussion! A Park Bench Panel consists of a panel with at least one open seat, available to anyone in the audience. When someone claims the empty seat, the conversation is paused until another panelist leaves, ensuring one seat is always available for new perspectives.</p>
    <p>
        Each breakout room is made up of three rooms with the dividers removed. For each of the breakout rooms listed on the schedule you'll find them by looking for any of the room numbers listed.
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><b>breakout 1</b> - Room 317, 318, and 319</li> 
            <li><b>breakout 2</b> - Room 307, 308, and 309</li>
        </ul>
