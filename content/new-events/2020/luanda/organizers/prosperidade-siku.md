Computer Engineering student at the Methodist University of Angola. In my spare time I study web programming, computer teaching from the user&#39;s perspective in some training centers in my neighborhood, and I work on environmental projects. I am currently learning about project management and that is what I will be working on at DevOps Days Luanda.
