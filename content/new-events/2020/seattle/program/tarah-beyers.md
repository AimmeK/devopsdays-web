Does your organization lack diversity? Do you struggle to find and attract diverse talent? Does your organization have a number of individuals at risk for displacement? Are you looking to make a career move into IT?

If you have answered "yes" to any of these questions, this is the talk for you. I will share stories about success we have had at Target attracting new talent to the industry and upskilling / reskilling potential talent, while sharing my background and motivation for sparking a new movement in Tech @ Target.
