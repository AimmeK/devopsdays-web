Building an inclusive culture takes work. What is an inclusive culture? How do we go about building a welcoming environment where all can thrive at work? While there are many answers to these questions, Erin postulates that building an inclusive culture can be done, in part, by leveling up your team’s DevOps processes.

We will walk through tools Erin’s team used to both improve their DevOps processes and create an environment where everyone is setup for success. By implementing processes like git hooks and consistent scripts throughout projects, you too can leverage DevOps to build a more inclusive culture.
