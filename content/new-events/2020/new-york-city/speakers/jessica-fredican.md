I have over 12 years of product experience focused on building consumer-grade products for enterprises, including Flatiron Health, Capital One and Blue Cross Blue Shield. Iâ€™m passionate about the engineering experience and building relationships between product and engineering that facilitate their ability to ship products customers love.
