Iâ€™ve been moving between Dev and Ops roles for the past 12 years or so. I worked (and still do) for big corporations with heavy processes and red tape and I am trying to streamline and automate their pipelines and bring new technology into their world. So generally fighting with the windmills and trying to make sure that people can actually do what they need to do.
