I have covered a number of different fields over the past 8 years; ranging from marketing and brand management through sales and key accounting to recruiting &amp; HR. I am passionate about fast-paced start-up environment and helping companies grow rapidly. My last working experience brought me to a DevOps company; where I have started to actively build DevOps community via meetups, knowledge sharing and networking as well as had the opportunity to get involved in agile software development.
