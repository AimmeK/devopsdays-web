On March 12th the WHO officially declared the COVID-19 virus a pandemic - and while we were planning to follow this advice the BC health minister has now also officially enacted a ban on events larger than 250 people. <br>We are forced to make the difficult decision to postpone the event until March 2021. We are looking into providing refunds to all stakeholders, but are unsure to what extent refunds will be possible and hope to have more information within the week. As a small, volunteer-only non-profit we are constrained on time; so we appreciate your patience while we reconcile finances.
<br><br>
For more details on the WHO’s response, please see:

<br>
Thank you again for your continued support of DevOpsDays, and we deeply apologize for any inconvenience caused. If you have any questions - don’t hesitate to reach out.
<br><br>
Kind Regards,
<br>
Devopsdays Vancouver Organizers
