      <h3>Your DevOpsDays Singapore Experience</h3>

After lunch we have a series of lightning talks and then self-organize a series of small groups called openspaces.

      <p>Expect talks and discussions from diverse voices on topics like developing resilient applications, monitoring and observability, building application security in via continuous integration, culture hacks, kubernetes tips, hiring good engineers, and many other subjects. Check out some talks from previous years on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvKd52G5RaLAWVugTdY4pBA">YouTube</a> or follow us at <a href="https://twitter.com/DevOpsDaysSG">@DevOpsDaysSG on Twitter</a>.</p>
      <p>Our theme this year is the Cloud Operations. As more teams build and host applications and infrastructure in the cloud, the term <strong>CloudOps</strong> has gained traction. IT operations professionals have always been responsible for the monitoring, maintenance and installation of servers, networks and other IT infrastructure. With proliferation of API for cloud we have seen more automation services for change management and chargeback, maintaining compliance and configuration.</p>
