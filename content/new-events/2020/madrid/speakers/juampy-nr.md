Hi! I am @juampynr. I work as a Senior Developer at Lullabot.

I am specialized in web development using Drupal. I have spoken in several Drupal.org events such as DrupalCons (Munich, Amsterdam, and Nashville), Developer Days (Dublin and Szeged) Drupalcamps (Spain, Bolivia, Mexico and Costa Rica), and my local group in Madrid.
