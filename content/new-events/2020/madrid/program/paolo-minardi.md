In this talk we'll talk about how the Serverless paradigms are changing the way we develop applications and the cloud infrastructures and how we can do serverless in an more efficient way also with Kubernetes. We'll go through the latest Kubernetes Serverless technologies, talking about all the aspects including pricing, scalability, observability and best practices.
