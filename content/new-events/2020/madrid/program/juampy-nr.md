There is a strong competition on Continuous Integration tools which may complicate development teams to decide which tool to use. At the begining of last year I started evaluating them in articles, publishing installers, and giving talks about my findings.

This session will compare, among others, the following CI tools for web development:

- CircleCI
- Travis CI
- GitLab CI
- GitHub Actions
