Brian Devlin is (presumably) a human who enjoys activities of various natures. Brian is a father who lives in the suburbs. He enjoys board games and beverages, in no specific order. He may or may not have a shadow Twitter account. He tweets only during warm weather. Once, Brian vaulted over the Chicago River, but that could have been in his imagination. Brian invented DevOps, but not the DevOps you know.
