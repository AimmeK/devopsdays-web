I'm constantly asked about a CI/CD implementation for infrastructure, and CodePipeline is a new player in the game. On this talk, I'm going to share my experience working with it - there are good things, also definitely room for improvement - and how it compares to similar tools on the market.

The talk is delivered in an upbeat and energetic fashion to invite the audience to think about what challenges they may have experienced or what would they like to see implemented in CodePipeline.
