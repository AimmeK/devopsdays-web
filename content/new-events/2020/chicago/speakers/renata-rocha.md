I started using computers in the late 80s, and have always been fascinated by how they work and how to manage them. I have an innate curiosity to try new systems and love automating things, from large scale mail servers to something as trivial as my own home - I didn't choose DevOps as a career, it was a natural path for someone like me.

I am obsessed with verbose debug logs, having a trustworthy terminal window always open and - of course - cats :)
