Michal Bryxí works as a frontend developer at CrowdStrike, has tons of IT side projects and loves his non-computer activities (running, cycling, climbing). He promotes good UX and technology that makes people’s lives easier. He firmly believes in the “more beertime” approach when solving devops problems. And he’s not scared to call out technology that sux (check out \#iCanBreakItForYou hashtag).
