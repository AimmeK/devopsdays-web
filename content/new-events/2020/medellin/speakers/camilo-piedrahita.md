Informatic engineer, Iâ€™m currently working as a software engineer and DevOps manager at Bancolombia. I have participated in different software development projects for large companies and startups. I have led the adoption of DevSecOps practices in organizations such as Suramericana, Bancolombia and startups. During my experience I have led organizations to change their software development practices to generate more resilient, scalable, testable and secure applications.
