Michigan and Detroit, specifically, are uniquely positioned to lead this integration due to its highly skilled engineers. We are a collection of makers with a common vision for excellence, change and the grit to reinvent a city.</p>

<p>Presentations will have a broad range of topics, with something for everyone. This conference is about much more than the tools we use. It is a forum for exploring the cultural impact that DevOps has on an organization. Hearing this positive, powerful message from our peers is the best way to integrate this way of thinking.</p>
