<h1>Due to the COVID-19 situation, we have decided to postpone the event to February 3-4, 2021.
We will automatically postpone your ticket to these dates, unless you prefer a full refund of course.
If you have any questions, you can contact us: aarhus@devopsdays.org.
Until then be safe, and keep the DevOps practices going!</h1>
