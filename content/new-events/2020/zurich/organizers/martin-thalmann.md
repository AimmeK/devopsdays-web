I’m a passionate DevOps Enthusiast who strongly believes in the power of this movement. I’m currently helping a Swiss telco operator in adapting DevOps principles in a large enterprise. Beside that I’m co-organizer of the [DevOps Enthusiast Meetup in Zurich](https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Meetup-Zurich/). I do have a background as a Software Engineer and experience in several Line- and Project-Management positions.
