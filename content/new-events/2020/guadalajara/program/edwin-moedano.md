In times when delivery automation matters, many solutions raise to solve this issue but sometimes these solutions requires time to implement or some background in cloud platforms. In this talk we explore the perks and limitations of implementing version control platforms to simplify CI/CD for anyone

This talk is focused on exploring possible scenarios and when it make sense to use CI/CD automation tools provided by version control platforms like Gitlab CI or Github Actions instead of implementing or configuring other robust solutions like Spinnaker, Jenkins, among others.
