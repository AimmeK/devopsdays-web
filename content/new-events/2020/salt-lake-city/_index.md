<h2>Salt Lake City DevOpsDays 2020 - Canceled</h2>
<h3>Every year, we look forward to connecting with our local DevOps community at SLC DevOps Days; Sharing and learning from experts in our community, and working with DevOps thought leaders that visit our event. But given the growing concerns around COVID-19, we've made the difficult decision to cancel Salt Lake City DevOps Days for 2020 due to the uncertainties of having a large event gathering.

Canceling the event was a tough decision to make. We have thoroughly enjoyed planning SLC DevOps Days, and it's one of our favorite ways to engage our local community. However, we need to prioritize the health and safety of our Community, Organizers, Sponsors, and everyone who helps make SLC DevOps days great. We are exploring the possibility of hosting the event later in the year. Based on current government guidelines and the general uncertainty around how this virus behaves, we are unable to confirm if this will be the case at this point.

Those of you who have registered for the event, SLC DevOps Days, will be provided a full refund within the next week.

We would also like to thank our Sponsors, Launch Darkly, Splunk, and GitLab, for being fantastic community supporters. We look forward to working with you in the future.

On behalf of the SLC DevOps Days staff, Board of Directors, and conference volunteers, thank you for being a part of the local DevOps community.
</h3>
