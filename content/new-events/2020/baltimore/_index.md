# We’re very sorry to announce that DevOpsDays Baltimore 2020 has been canceled.

### Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and growing concern over the spread of the disease, we have decided not to hold DevOpsDays Baltimore 2020.  Many factors went into this decision, and all of it together led to the feeling that this is the right decision for our community.  Ultimately, the health and well-being of all involved is our top priority.  We had considered postponing to later in the year, but given the level of uncertainty and rapid change in this situation, we don’t feel comfortable committing to a new date.

### From all the organization team, we want to sincerely thank you for your interest in DevOpsDays Baltimore, and we look forward to seeing you next year.

## What now?

### We are very fortunate to have enough time to cancel before the majority of our event obligations.  With that, we’re pleased to be able to offer full refunds to both attendees and sponsors.  We will begin processing refunds, and you should receive notification within one week.

### If you have any questions, please feel free to **{{< event_link page="contact" text="reach out to us." >}}**  If email is too formal, drop a line in `#devopsdays-baltimore` on the **{{< event_link url-key="slack_link" text="Baltimore Tech Community Slack" >}}**
