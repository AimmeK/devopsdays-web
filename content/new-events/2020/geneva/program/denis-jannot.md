In this talk, I'm quickly introduction the concept of a Service Mesh and why it becomes so popular.
Then, I'm explaining how Istio works and can be deployed across several public clouds to provide busting and disaster recovery capabilities.
Finally, I'm doing a live demo showing a multi site deployment in action. In this demo, I deploy Istio on 2 Kubernetes clusters running in different regions. I simulate load and failures to share best practices about how to setup a global Service Mesh properly.
