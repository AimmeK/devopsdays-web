At Babylon Health, we are on a mission to put accessible and affordable healthcare in the hands of every person on Earth. You might imagine that such an endeavour would generate incredible amounts of data! And, since AI is in the core of our product, leveraging data from our microservices and clients is crucial to our success. So we set off to build a data platform of the future, based both in AWS and GCP, leveraging our existing infrastructure and CICD and building the missing parts.
