Co-founder and CTO of SoKube, but especially addict to new technologies around Kubernetes and its ecosystem.
I started as a Java/JEE developer working as a consultant and publisher. I gained solid experience in application integration and enterprise architectures working in the banking world. This led me to design and implement microservices architectures, service-oriented architectures as well as distributed systems.
I am now very involved in the world of containerization, orchestration, CI / CD and DevOps
