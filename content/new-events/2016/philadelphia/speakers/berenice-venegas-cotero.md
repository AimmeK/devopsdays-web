A physicist that once fell to the stars of Astrophysics.

However, being experimentalist and theoretician at heart, her love eventually fell for molecular Biophysics,
researching the cooperative but elusive behavior of lipids
designed nanoliposomes for targeted drug delivery.

Her first close encounter with a computer
was a PRIME 750, exclusively used
to scare mother, who run batch jobs
filling her terminal screen with infinite error messages and warnings.

As a good physicist,
only UNIX style computing was acceptable.
Unfortunately learned some Windows
well into the new millennium
which then regretted quite a bit.


Research brought dynamic and Monte Carlo simulations,
experimental data required analysis automation
so cloud computing offered attractive adventures
Big data IoT pipelines dockerization Oh My!

DevOps has become her fascinating playground.
Feeling infinite compute power at the fingertips,
she automates infrastructure up from the ground
never having a particular server relationship

Besides obvious interest of maxing out cloud resources
she likes unplanned travels and being outdoors
gymnastics, including mind ones
and collecting fine peppers for cooking.

In free time she likes rescuing any pet
especially ones being a 'poor thing'.
