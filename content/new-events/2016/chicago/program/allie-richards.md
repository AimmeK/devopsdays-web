  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
What's that creature living in my cloud?
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
DevOps has a well-established relationship with animals, particularly cattle and pets. Many attempts to "cattlle-ize" existing systems stall halfway, leading to somewhat different outcomes and leaving operations teams wondering what happened. This talk will focus on some common hurdles encountered when to moving towards the servers as cattle model and discuss some ways to identify and address them.
