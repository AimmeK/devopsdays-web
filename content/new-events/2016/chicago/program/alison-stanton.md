  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Ways DevOps Could Be More Accessible
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
I probably am doing DevOps without even knowing it. When I discovered the DevOps Dictionary definition of "goat" I fell in love. My perspective on DevOps as a self-taught woman in technology and what the DevOps community could be more inclusive and accessible to me and other people I know.
