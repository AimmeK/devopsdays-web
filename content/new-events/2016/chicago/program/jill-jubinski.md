  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
DevOps'ing Recruitment
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
All aspects of DevOps are difficult; acknowledging, implementing, hell even defining. But do you know whats even harder then DevOps? People. Finding, recruiting and retaining.
</p>
<p>
Weâ€™ve seen great strides in the DevOps community in terms of changing the way engineering teams think about process and procedures, but why stop there? Why not use DevOps principles in another aspect of technology that seems to be broken; recruitment.
