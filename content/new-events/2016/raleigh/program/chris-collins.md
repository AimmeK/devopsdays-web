  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Embracing the Container
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Your servers are purring like lolcats and you’ve got it all down to a science - but now everyone is talking about these new-fangled “containers”.  Learn about integrating containers into a mature environment: new infrastructure and workflows, pitfalls, “ah-ha” moments, and re-considering the last decade or two of system administration practices.</p>
