<p><strong>Title:</strong> Pentesting ChatOps</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>Super inspired by last year's DevOpsDays talk, Radically Open Security embraced the concept of ChatOps for security audits and penetration testing - and the results have been nothing short of phenomenal! This talk will introduce the basics of Pentesting ChatOps, and will discuss the processes and open-source tools (RocketChat, Hubot, Gitlab, various pentesting tools) needed to enable Pentesting ChatOps within your own organization.</p>
