Clinton Wolfe leads the DevOps Practice at OmniTI, which means he voluntarily chooses to go into heavily siloed, dysfunctional organizations and try to get them to talk to each other with as few stabbings as possible. He's especially interested in testable infrastructure, and the processes needed to support quality throughout the application lifecycle. He is also Oliver and Sylviaâ€™s Daddy.
