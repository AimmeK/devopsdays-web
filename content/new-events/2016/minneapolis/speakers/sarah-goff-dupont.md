Sarah has been working in and around software teams for 14 years â€“ as QA engineer, agile coach, and now a marketer. When not writing about all things agile and/or automated, she can be found reading contemporary fiction, smashing it out & keeping it real at CrossFit, or rolling around on the floor with her kids (possibly all at once).
