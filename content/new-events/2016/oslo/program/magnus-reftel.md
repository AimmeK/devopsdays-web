Behaviour-Driven Devops
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>

<p>As one way of bringing the Ops closer to the Devs, we're using Cucumber to describe our systems from an operations perspective. Which application is dependent on which? How are they configured? How should they behave in network outages? It's all in the Gherkin.</p>
