**Title:** Bots Not Cattle Ignite

**Description:**

"Cattle Not Pets" got us to the first generation of microservice infrastructures. Now it's time for a second generation metaphor: "Bots Not Cattle." Intelligent, autonomous microservices which "just do the right thing" which permit us to go beyond the current limits of orchestration and configuration management are not only achievable, but easier than you'd expect.
