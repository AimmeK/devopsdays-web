**Title:** Encouraging Future Leaders

**Description:**

Leadership development is about helping others to grow. As leaders, how are we creating opportunities for other leaders to emerge and allowing them to grow? In our journeys, we’ve gone from feeling “no one is stepping up” to recognizing that today’s leaders show up in a different way if you expand your view to see them. It’s rare to find someone like yourself to handle certain responsibilities, and being open to new ideas and new practices can pave the way for more leaders to emerge. Regardless of title or role, teams and groups can evolve from “leadership from a few” to becoming “leaderful.”
