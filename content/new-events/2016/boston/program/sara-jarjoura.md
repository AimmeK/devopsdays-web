  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  STEM Skills through Minecraft
  </p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>
  How do you start young people out with STEM skills, and DevOps in particular?  Make it useful, make it fun!

I taught my nine year old nephew to take his Minecraft game to a whole new level by showing him how to administer a remote Minecraft server, a Docker container running on Digital Ocean.
