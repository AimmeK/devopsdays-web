  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  Code Review for Operations
  </p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>
   Code review has always been used by developers, recently operations has started as well. How is it different when operators are reviewing code that has an operations impact? How can it be optimized? Our team has been reviewing ops code for years, and I'm here to share the lessons we learned.
