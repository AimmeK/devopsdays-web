  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  Redefining collaboration norms as your company grows
  </p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
  <p>
  DevOps is all about collaboration, but what does that mean at a growing
  company? Abstractions tend to wall us off from each other, but they also
  provide the opportunity to experiment (e.g., don't need to wait for ops to
  spin you a server up to try something out). As companies grow,
  communication overhead increases. As your organization grows, different
  techniques are needed to prevent everyone from getting bogged down.
