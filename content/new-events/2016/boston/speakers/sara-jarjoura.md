I'm a DevOps Engineer, and I'm happiest when spawning invisible computers in "the cloud."  I started out in the tech field in 2007 when I attended my first web development meetup in Providence and learned what "WYSIWYG" meant.  Nowadays you can find me at DevOps meetups or hanging around in the Seaport district.
