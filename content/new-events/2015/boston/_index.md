<p>On <strong>Tuesday, September 15th and Wednesday, September 16th</strong>, DevOpsDays is returning to Boston!</p>

<p>The event's schedule will consist of a mixture of traditional sessions, ignite talks,
and the unique "open space" format that DevOpsDays is known for. We've reserved the first floor of the <a href="/events/2015/boston/location">Microsoft NERD Center</a>
 and expect to fill it to capacity.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: Microsoft has been extremely generous in providing us access to their private space to
host this event. To repay their generosity, we ask that you pay attention to their guidelines.
Most importantly, <strong>you must present identification to sign into the building!</strong> If you don't bring
identification on the day of the event, you will not be permitted to attend.</em></p>
