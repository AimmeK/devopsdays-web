In the last few years software companies have been forced to shrink their 
development cycles. At Datys we start adopting agile practices in Development. 
Continuous integration allowed the development team to remove delays due to 
integration problems. But Operations were left behindâ€¦ Adopting containers 
and automating our deployment process using open source technologies, allowed 
us to release applications and services multiple times a day. In this 
presentation we share our experiences in this journey. We will show how 
we set up Continuous Delivery pipelines with Gitlab, Apache Mesos and 
Marathon. We hope that the real-world story of a small company overcoming 
the challenges we faced can help others to continue in their DevOps journey.
