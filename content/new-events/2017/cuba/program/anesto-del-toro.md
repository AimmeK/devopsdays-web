In this talk weâ€™ll share some experiences during the development of the 
CIR-BCC (Risk Information Center - Cuban Central Bank). We briefly 
describe the problem, the main challenges and their impact in key 
architectural and design decisions. We present some insights of our 
reactive modular solution, developed with Scala, Play Framework and 
Akka, and we illustrate how Event Sourcing (ES), Command-Query 
Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Change Data Capture (CDC) 
have helped us to solve some important challenges. We expose several 
of the practices that have allowed us to achieve faster development 
and deployment cycles for this product.
