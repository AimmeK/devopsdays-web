The “right” architecture and organization depends on the size and scale of your company. 
The only constant is change, and what works for 5 engineers does not work for 5000. 
Based upon lessons from Google and eBay, learn how to evolve both technology and 
organization together successfully.

This presentation is based on many hard-won lessons by the speaker, who led 
large-scale engineering teams at Google and eBay, but also co-founded a tiny 
startup and tried (unsuccessfully) to apply the same techniques. This session 
hopes to help others from making the same mistakes by introducing the concept 
of “Minimal Viable Architecture”. It outlines the common architectural evolution 
of a company or project through the search, execution, and scaling phases, and 
discusses the appropriate technologies, disciplines, and organizational structures 
at each phase.
