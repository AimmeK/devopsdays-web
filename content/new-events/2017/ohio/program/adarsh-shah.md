Conwayâ€™s Law says that "Organizations which design systems, are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations". The communication structures are heavily influenced by how the teams are structured and whether they can create a culture of shared responsibility.

In this presentation, Adarsh Shah will talk about various team structures and how DevOps culture prospers in those structures. He will explain when and why these team structures can be beneficial and what are the various paths that he has seen organizations take during the DevOps transformation journey from Dev & Ops silo to one of these team structures & their pros & cons.
