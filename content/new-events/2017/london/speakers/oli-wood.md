Oli Wood spends most of his time helping to stabalise and improve systems deployed into cloud hosted environments having done so for the last 14 years or so for companies ranging from 2 person start ups to government systems (before they got good). He spends his time working on infrastructure and deployment systems so nobody notices he's a terrible developer.
