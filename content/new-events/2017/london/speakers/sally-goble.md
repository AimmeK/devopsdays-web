Sally Goble is Head of Quality at the Guardian, and has worked on almost every product that the Guardian has produced, from the glamorous to the offbeat. She has worked in software development for more than 10 years. In her current role, she is at the forefront of leading a change in the way the QA team thinks about improving quality of products - moving away from conventional testing towards more tooling and process changes. She is also one of fewer than 500 women to have swum the English Channel solo.
