Devops originally started as a way of enabling both developers and operations engineers to work better together, but over the years since its inception it has become much more than that. The principles of devops can be beneficial to everyone involved in creating software solutions, not just two teams. This talk will discuss practical ideas for how the four pillars of effective devops can be used throughout an organization, and the benefits of spreading operational thinking further than just the ops team.
