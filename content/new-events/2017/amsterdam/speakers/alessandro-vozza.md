Alessandro is a Technical Evangelist at Microsoft and loves everything open source (reads the previous sentence again, it's not an oxymoron!). He's been active for several years in communities in and around Amsterdam, and he's frequently seen eating pizza at Meetups; he holds a degree in Chemistry and he's not afraid to use it. Passions: Containers, Cloud, DevOps and the superposition of those.
