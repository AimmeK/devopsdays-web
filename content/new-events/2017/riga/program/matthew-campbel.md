<p>Achieving continuous delivery is no small feat. It is even more challenging when you do it within an Enterprise software company. In this talk, Matthew will walk you through how they did just that at D2L moving from releasing twice a year to releasing multiple times a month. On top of technical challenges (of which they had many), they had both internal and external resistance to the changes they were making.</p>

<p>He will share with you the architecture they chose for their deployment model that allows them to have zero-downtime deployments. Then Matthew will outline the challenges they faced as they implemented their solution (including technical, people, and process) and how they worked through (or around) them. Finally Matthew will share with you his biggest regrets and what he would do differently if he ever needed to do this again.</p>
