<p><em>Since organisations are already struggling with getting compliant to the security standards like ISO 27001/2, it’s even harder to get the right measures in place for the GDPR.</em></p>

<p><em>Topics: the relation between privacy and security, Privacy by Design, translate GDPR into useful privacy requirements.</em></p>

<p>Organisations are preparing for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the latest European privacy law. Since organisations are already struggling with getting compliant to the security standards like ISO 27001/2, NEN 7510 or Dutch baseline as BIR / BIG/ BIWA, it’s even harder to get the right measures in place for the GDPR.</p>
<p>In this presentation, we start with the relations between privacy and security. And why it is even more relevant to Shift left in the development lifecycle (Privacy by Design). Then we will discuss some articles from the GDPR and will translate them into useful privacy requirements. This will demonstrate why you must have privacy and security requirements in place even before you start building or changing a system.</p>
<p>Next, to the requirement, we will end with the articles which are beneficial for organisations.</p>
<p>Take away: some generic user and abuser stories which are relevant for most applications.</p>
