Istio is a new open platform providing managed traffic flows between containers with fine grained control, policy support, service-to-service authentication, integrated metrics, load balancing and more. In this talk Christopher Aedo will cover where this project came from, what you can do with it now, and where it's headed in the future. A live demo will be included to demonstrate the concepts covered.
