Barbara Mandrell wrote the theme song for my life with her hit I was #devops when #devops wasn't cool.

I'm lucky to currently be at [RealSelf](https://www.realself.com/), helping people find information they can trust about life changing decisions. Previously, I've had the privilege of working at Fortune 100s, and scrappy 10 person startups.
