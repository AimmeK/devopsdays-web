Christopher Aedo has been working with and contributing to open source software since his college days. Most recently he can be found leading an amazing team of upstream developers at IBM who are also developer advocates. When he’s not at work or speaking at a conference, he’s probably using a RaspberryPi to brew and ferment a tasty homebrew in Portland OR.
