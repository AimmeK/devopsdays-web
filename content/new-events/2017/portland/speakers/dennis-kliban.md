I have been contributing to open source software since 2010. After joining Red Hat in 2013, I have had the opportunity to contribute to multiple projects written in Python: Imagefactory, OpenStack Nova, and Pulp. I am interested in crafting tools that we all can use to improve the quality of software delivered to our users.
