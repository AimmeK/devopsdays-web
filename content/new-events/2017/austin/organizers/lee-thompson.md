Lee has been an organizer/volunteer for DevOpsDays Austin since its founding and participated in the organization of the first US DevOpsDays event in Mountain View in 2010.  He keeps coming back to DevOpsDays because he still hasn&#39;t figured it all out yet.  When not messing with distributed applications, he&#39;s messing around with 240Z&#39;s and Airstreams.
