"Blameless postmortems" and "learning from failure" are very en
vogue in the technology industry right now. Both fall into that
less-discussed category of "CI": Continuous Improvement. But for as much as
we all talk about them, in many organizations and teams, the outcome of
continual organizational learning and improvement remains elusive. Why is
this?

In this talk, we'll look at five "dirty words"* that are often thrown
around during postmortems, retrospectives, and other learning exercises
that not only make it difficult for teams to discuss learning, but promote
activities and behaviors that are actually counterproductive to continuous
improvement. We'll dig into the existing research on why this is--it turns
out we're not the only industry struggling with this!--and look at some
different language we can start using that can more ably facilitate
sustainable Continuous Improvement in our work environments.

*Not actually dirty words.
