Ed is a 20&#43; year veteran of the software industry who has worked in numerous roles from tech support to QA and even management (!).  He is passionate about software quality and software engineering efficiency and an unabashed kanban fanboy. He is also a philosopher, lover of fine food and cocktails, occasional DJ and master of the rhetorically awkward question. Ed is currently employed at Cure Forward as a “DevOps Engineer” where he is developing infrastructure to match cancer patients with clinical trials and helping developers understand the operational implications of the code they write.
