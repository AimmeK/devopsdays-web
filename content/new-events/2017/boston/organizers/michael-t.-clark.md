Michael is a veteran systems management professional. In a career that has ranged from academic computing to finance to manufacturing and now, professional services, he has worked as a front-line technician, a back-office systems engineer, an enterprise architect, and a leader of teams of 100&#43; technologists in hybrid WAN, large-scale domestic and global computing environments. His passions encompass envisioning, designing, building, and improving business and organizational systems of all varieties and at every scale. He is equally comfortable learning something new at a command line and in the C-suite helping senior executives make sense of their IT strategy and spend. He is particularly passionate about helping systems professionals develop better ways to work together, improve the products they deliver, and most importantly, the culture of the workplaces in which we all labor.
