Hi, I’m Laura. I believe that done is better than perfect, that iteration, simplicity, and customer feedback are keys to success, and that community-driven efforts lead to powerful change. When I’m not working (Senior Site Reliability Engineer at Klaviyo) or organizing the PyLadies Boston and Boston Devops meetups, I enjoy a nice cup of tea and board games with friends.
