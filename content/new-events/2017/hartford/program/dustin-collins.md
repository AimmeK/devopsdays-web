In this lightning talk I want to debunk the myths of the inside attacker. The cybersecurity industry tends to use language that alienates people and buries serious problems. ‘Inside attacker’ is just another example of this.

At the end of the talk the audience will have: an overview of the history of the term ‘inside attacker’, how it is commonly used in industry, the problem with using that term and some remediations.
