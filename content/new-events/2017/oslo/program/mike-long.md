In Science, progress follows a path from tool development, leading to data, then on to theory. In software as well as science we have seen long periods of normal science and puzzle solving, and disruptive paradigm shifts. 

In Sapiens, Yuval Noah Harari describes the cognitive revolution as "The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago".  

This talk will provide a new view of the DevOps movement, through the lens of scientific and cognitive revolutions.  It will show how to make strategic choices in recruitment, organization, culture, and technology to best situate an organization for success in this brave new world.
