Most material available these days cover DevOps from a very web centric perspective. The pains and problems however are equally real in the embedded space. Software development has similar challenges across different industries but companies in the embedded space aren’t aware of or able to leverage existing tools and processes that they may believe aren’t relevant to their industry.

This is our journey towards embracing DevOps and transforming our development process within an embedded space. From embracing CI to incorporation test automation in an embedded environment, this talk will cover the challenges we had and our approach to solving them.
