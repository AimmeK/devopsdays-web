Fast response to changing markets, flexible automation and cross organizational integration
are the key features for the industrial landscape of the future.

I've first learned about DevOps about 2 years ago. With my background of industrial
automation I felt somehow as a stranger while attending my first DevOps conference. After
a while it dawned on me that DevOps can solve many problems in my working area.

This talk is about what I've learned from DevOps. I will describe common problems and
pitfalls that arise from cross organizational scaling of automation and give a short
overview of the requirements for a software to support agile management of production
environments.
