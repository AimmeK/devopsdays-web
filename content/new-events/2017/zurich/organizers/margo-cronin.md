I am a cloud architect, Irish, living in Switzerland for 12 years. My background is in both program management and architecture. I fell upon DevOps while struggling to get Scrum adopted and working in large financial enterprises, DevOps saved us and its been love ever since. &lt;p&gt; In my spare time I like to dance, hike, ski and affectionately tease the Swiss.
