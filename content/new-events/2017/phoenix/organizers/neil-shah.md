Born in San Diego and raised here in beautiful Scottsdale, AZ, Neil is a proud Sun Devil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After three years of pounding the pavement as an IBM field tech, Neil got his start in tech recruiting and has never looked back. He is focused on the long-term relationships and friendships he forms with candidates and clients alike. More than that, he gets to spend his entire day talking about all the fun new tech toys out there.
