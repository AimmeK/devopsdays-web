Eric Harris is a recent transplant to the Phoenix area, moving from Fargo in 2015 to join LifeLock (now Symantec). He comes from the traditional sysadmin role, managing a dial-up &amp; wireless ISP as well as network and web infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eric has worked closely with web developers and learned to highly value cooperation and communication in cross functional teams. Taking a step back from management, he continues those practices at Symantec today in an IC role focused on devops practices.
