This year’s list topics included: Security, Containers, BizOps, Scaling, and many other areas of interest. With a mix of in-depth talks and laser focused Ignite talks, you are sure to walk away having learned something new.</p>

    <p><strong>Sharing</strong></p>

    <p>One of the great parts of DevOpsDays is learning from other attendees.  There will be plenty of time to share success and failure stories with each other, get feedback on your next crazy idea, ask for help solving a real world problem you are facing when you go back to work on Wednesday.</p>
