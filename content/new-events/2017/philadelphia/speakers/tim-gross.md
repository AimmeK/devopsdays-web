Tim Gross is Principal DevOps Engineer at Density, where he's bringing his expertise in containers and building robust software to machine learning applications on the Internet of Things. Previously he was a product manager and open source developer at Joyent, built the operations team at DramaFever, and long ago was an architect of buildings, not software. Tim took the leap into programming and Operations after he discovered he could automate away almost everything boring in his life.
