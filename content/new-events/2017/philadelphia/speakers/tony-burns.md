I am a software engineer, and system operations enthusiast. Starting with a strong development background in Ruby on Rails, I rapidly became interested in the new DevOps movement and everything that comes with it, with a focus on developing and administering test-driven cloud infrastructure on Amazon Web Services.

In 2011, I co-authored and published 'Deploying Rails: Automate, Deploy, Scale, Maintain, and Sleep at Night' with Tom Copeland and The Pragmatic Programmers, and spoke with Tom about Rails deployment at RailsConf 2011.
