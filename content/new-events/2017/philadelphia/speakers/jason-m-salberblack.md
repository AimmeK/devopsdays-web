Jason Salber-Black spearheads DevOps adoption at Swift Financial, working to blend changes to tooling, workflow, and communication into a better process for everyone. Jason is a firm adherent to the truisms: anything that can go wrong will go wrong given time so be prepared for failure; routinely regenerated infrastructure is reliable infrastructure; and everyone needs a copy editor.
