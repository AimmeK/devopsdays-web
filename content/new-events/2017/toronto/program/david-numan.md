This ignite talk will share case study learnings on using free and open source tools to automate the development, testing, QA, and deployment of a complex US government web site.

Operations people want stability. Developers want change.

Using docker, gitlab, and other supporting tools, we achieve consistently stable deployments as developers continue to improve the product. Running automated tests on every merge request ensures that broken code is never pushed to production. Today's tools make it possible to unify the infrastructure for the dev team, QA sites, automated testing, and deployment.
