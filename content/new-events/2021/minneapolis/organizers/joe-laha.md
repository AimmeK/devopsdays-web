Joe Laha works in event technology, which is a fancy way of saying he&#39;s a professional flipchart jockey. He lives in Minneapolis&#39; North Loop neighborhood with his partner Bridget Kromhout, their cats Iria &amp; Nimoy, and way too much cycling-themed art. Aside from cycling, Joe enjoys homebrew, heavy metal guitar, and arguing about sci-fi TV of the 1990s.
