&lt;p&gt;Franziska loves to combine her favorite topics DevOps, IT security and open source software. And that&#39;s exactly what she can pursue as an architect at Puzzle ITC! As a former speaker at the DevOpsDays Zurich, organizer of the ModSecurity CRS Meetup Bern and an enthusiastic OWASP member, Franziska also has the opportunity to share her passion with others. When she isn&#39;t disassembling highly optimized regexes or automating security, she enjoys spending time with her family.&lt;/p&gt;
