&lt;p&gt;Having worked as a developer, systems engineer and team lead in IT operations, the ideas and concepts behind DevOps are very close to my heart. As I am passionate about coding since my teenage years, I am fascinated by concepts like Infrastructure as Code, Social Coding, and cloud native technologies trying to get hands-on whenever possible. I enjoy lateral thinking and my basic premise is that we cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them (Albert Einstein). In my current role I dedicate all my energy to introducing and spreading DevOps principles and practices in the broader organization.&lt;/p&gt;
