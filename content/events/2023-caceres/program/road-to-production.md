<p>What should be the anatomy of my deployment pipeline? How can my deployment pipeline support applications, infrastructure, and data through the road to production? If you thought or have to answer these questions this session is for you. I will share the principles that make a deployment pipeline an effective pipeline covering the different challenges through the different stages of the pipeline: version control, continuous integration, and continuous delivery. The main focus is on the principles instead of on tools, and that's on purpose.</p>
