What if we were wrong about devops ? 
What if we were wrong about collaboration across  skill sets being a better approach ? 
What if we were wrong about automation and monitoring ?
What if we were wrong about Agile being the better approach  ? 
What if CI and CD (the integration and Delivery/Deployment variants) don't matter at all ? 
What if ...   Don't you worry at night  ?       Why are we doing the things we do  ?
Do you even remember why we do the things ?  Or have you never been told ? 

This Ignite will explore the idea that we were wrong about devops,  that none of it matters.

What if 5 minutes aren't enough for this ? :)
