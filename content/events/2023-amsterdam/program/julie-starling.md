Are you tired of having the same conversations, delivering "late" and being put under pressure for decisions you didn't even make? In this session, I'll walk through how we managed to flip the script in a highly regulated, risk-averse, financial institution by introducing probabilistic forecasting and flow metrics as well as ditching wasteful estimations.
I'll cover what you need to get started (very little!) and we'll explore things I wish we knew when we started our journey, including what is involved in making the mindset shift at an organisational level. I'll also be sharing some of the success stories we've seen, which include teams improving their ways of working based on data as well as critical decisions being made by stakeholders at the earliest possible opportunity rather than when we've missed a deadline.
Probabilistic forecasting has helped move our risk-averse stakeholders away from traditional and comfortable but ultimately higher-risk ways of workingâ€¦ however, we're still on our journey and there is so much more to come, so I'll also cover where we are going next and how we are using this alongside DORA metrics.
