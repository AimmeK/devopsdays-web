      <description>Devopsdays is a worldwide series of technical conferences covering topics of software development, IT infrastructure operations, and the intersection between them. Each event is run by volunteers from the local area.
Most devopsdays events feature a combination of curated talks (see open Calls for Proposals) and self organized open space content. Topics often include automation, testing, security, and organizational culture.
History The first devopsdays was held in Ghent, Belgium in 2009.</description>

      <description>Respect and empathy are core devops values. Devopsdays is dedicated to providing an environment where everyone in the devops community can learn and share in respectful, considerate collaboration.
Every devopsdays event has a code of conduct, and we expect the organizer community before, during, and after the conferences to follow a similar code of conduct.
Devopsdays is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for every participant, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), technology choices, or any other personal characteristics.</description>

      <description>Introduction Below is a small summary of an open space that took place at Devopsdays Ghent (October, 2014). The goal of the open space was to find ways on how Devopsdays organizers and attendees can contribute to NGOs or other good causes.
Two prior Devopsdays events donated some of the profits to charity. Devopsdays NY 2014 donated to the drilling of a well in Cambodia. Devopsdays Belgium 2014 donated to Manbarnootaaf VZW.</description>

      <description>Most devopsdays events are a combination of curated talks and self organized conversations. The self organized content is known as &amp;ldquo;open spaces&amp;rdquo;. Open Spaces give attendees the opportunity to talk about anything they&amp;rsquo;d like. A person might suggest a topic they want to learn about, or one they feel like they can help others with. The topics range widely, from highly technical, to pure culture, to board games for networking.</description>

      <description>Introduction Congratulations! The fact that you have reached this page means you at least have an interest in spreading the devops love to the world. Back in 2009 when we organized the first event, we were probably as excited as you are now. But we were also bit scared and full of questions: how does this work? how do we get sponsors? what is the first thing we have to do?</description>
